    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you get stuck in the traffic jam everyday while commuting to work?<br/>
Would you like to make use of this wasted time? Read on.<br/>
I usually spend a couple of hours commuting to/from work every day.<br/>
Sitting behind my steering wheel listening to the radio was not very rewarding.  <br/>
So I started exploring how I could better invest this lost time.</p>

<p>
From among the things I tried, these are the once that worked well.</p>

<h3>1. <a href="https://librivox.org/">LibriVox</a></h3>

<p>LibriVox brings you free recordings of books available in the public domain.
You can listen to free audio books from any connected device or even burn them onto a CD.</p>

<h3>2.  Commercial audio books</h3>

<p>If the book you&rsquo;re interesting in is not in the public domain, you might find a commercial audio version. Either on CD or a downloadable one, there are a lot of offers out <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=audio+books">there</a>.</p>

<h3>3. <a href="https://www.ted.com/">Ted Talks</a></h3>

<p>Listen to free talks on a large variety of subjects. Whatever your interest is, there&rsquo;s a chance you find interesting and inspiring talks on the subject.
Ted app let you download the talks for offline viewing.</p>

<h3>4. Online courses</h3>

<p>If it happens that you&rsquo;re following an online course, you can make use of the commute time to listen to the courses videos. Most of the platforms let you download the videos for offline viewing. Efficiency of this approach will depend on how much you need your eyes on the screen to understand the content.
What worked for me was listening to the video while commuting, and then reading the slides once back home.</p>

<h3>5. Google Play Books Reader</h3>

<p>You can make use of the Text-to-speech for Google Play content to read e-books.
For this you need to activate the &ldquo;Read aloud&rdquo; option form the top menu.
It only works with EPUB files, and I recommend activating the &ldquo;High quality voice&rdquo; option for a better listening experience.</p>

    <id>http://bil-t.github.io/blog/2015/05/01/an-octopress-slash-vagrant-experiment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my spare time, I like to try and learn new software technologies.
For this I use my Windows laptop. The problem is that after several cycles of installing and removing stuff, the laptop become slow. Its performance keep degrading with time until I take some time to reset its installation and reconfigure things.</p>

<p>Recently, after struggling with ruby installation on Windows I decided to reconsider Linux. Since I needed windows for other reasons, I decided to try using virtualization. I started by using <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> to configure a Linux guest machine. While discussing this with a friend, he suggested trying <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I visited <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> website and it immediately got my attention for its simplicity. All you need is a configuration file, a small set of commands and the virtual machine is up an running.<br/>
Playing around with Vagrant tutorial lead me to the idea of creating a sandbox for each software development experiment or project I work on.</p>

<p>I decided to test the idea of this sandbox on my next project: this blog.<br/>
As many software developers I settled on using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>/<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for my blog.<br/>
For this purpose, I needed a Linux machine with the required tools installed and a synced copy of the blog source. After several iteration I got to a stage where I&rsquo;m able to edit the blog from any computer connected to the internet. <br/>
In three steps I&rsquo;m able to deploy a blog sandbox and start blogging:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, install required tools: <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> and <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>.</li>
<li>Second, clone the blog repository,</li>
<li>Finally, start the sandbox by switching to its directory and running Vagrant up</li>
</ol>


<p>It took me some time to get to a simple and repeatable process.
I&rsquo;m glad of the results as I&rsquo;m using the sandbox to publish this post. This experiment showed me the real benefits from using <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ll be using it in future projects.</p>

<p>Although this post is not intended to be a tutorial on how to use <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> or <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, I&rsquo;m going to mention a couple of things I found interesting. I&rsquo;ll also write about some difficulties I encountered and how I solved them.</p>

<h3>What I liked most</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy X11 forwarding over SSH connections</strong> by adding <code>config.ssh.forward_x11 = true</code> to Vagranfile. With <a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/">MobaXterm</a> running on my Windows host I was able to display the guest.</li>
<li><strong>Easy port forwarding</strong> by adding <code>config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 4000, host: 4000</code> all traffic network to the port 4000 on the host machine, was actually forwarded to the guest machine on the specified port.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/">Vagrant synced folder</a></strong> enables editing the files from both the guest and the host.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What took me some time to figure out</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shell provisioner as <code>vagrant</code> user</strong> and not as root: using <code>privileged false</code> in Vagrantfile didn&rsquo;t work for me when setting local version of Ruby via rbenv. I finally settled on chaining a call to a script with the specified user <code>su -c "source /vagrant/vagrant/user-config.sh" vagrant</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blog preview only accessible from guest</strong>, at first I thought it was a problem with port forwarding, but finally, after tedious searches on the internet, I found out that binding the server to 0.0.0.0 in Rakefile was the solution. <br/>
<code>server_host     = "0.0.0.0"   # server bind address for preview server</code><br/>
<code>rackupPid = Process.spawn("rackup --host #{server_host} --port #{server_port}")</code></p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;re interessted in trying, the complete configuration is available in the  <a href="https://github.com/bil-t/octopress-vagrant-setup">octopress-vagrant-setup</a> github repository.</p>
