<p>After attending the <a href="https://open.hpi.de/courses/softwareanalytics2015/" title="Automated Visual Software Analytics">Automated Visual Software Analytics </a> online course I had an idea on computing some new metrics deduced from the VCS (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control" title="VCS">Version Control System</a>).</p>

<p>Since I want to make use of these metrics at work, my implementation should be
able to work against a <a href="http://www.perforce.com/" title="Perforce.com">Perforce</a> server, the VCS we mainly use.</p>

<p>In order to have the appropriate development environment I needed a Linux virtual machine on which Perforce is installed, configured an running properly.
I had previously used <a href="blog/2015/05/01/an-octopress-slash-vagrant-experiment/" title="An Octopress/Vagrant Experiment">Vagrant</a> to sandbox a development environment, and at that moment I knew it was the beginning of a long-term addiction.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, Perforce can be downloaded free for up to 20 users.<br/>
My goal was to configure a virtual machine via Vagrant and provision it by installing a perforce server, running it and make it accessible from the host machine.</p>

<p>Interested ? Here&rsquo;s how to do it.</p>

<p>Since I was already using a Vagrant virtual machine I had to pay attention to using a different set of ports.
The SSH port forwarding is bound, out of the box, to 2222. It was not clear in the documentation how to disable it. After several attempts and some googling I ended up by finding the right way to do it. For it to work you need to add the following two entries in the Vagrant file:</p>

<p><code>config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 22, host: 2222, id: "ssh", disabled: true</code>  <br/>
<code>config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 22, host: 2223, auto_correct: true</code></p>

<p>Perforce uses by default the port 1666, I chose to use the same port when forwarding it to the host.</p>

<h2>2. Provisioning: Installing and starting Perfoce</h2>

<p>Next I had to install perforce and run it. I was lucky enough to stumble upon an article that revealed to me the existence of a public Perforce FTP server.</p>

<p>Knowing that, I used a first provisioning shell script to download the perforce server binary (p4d) and its command line client (p4).</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span> (provision_once.sh)</span> <a href='http://bilal.eltayara.net/downloads/code/2015-05-20-vagrant-powered-perforce/provision_once.sh'>download</a></figcaption>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">fi</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A second provisioning script, executed with a non privileged user, starts the Perforce server and does a connection attempt.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span> (provision_always.sh)</span> <a href='http://bilal.eltayara.net/downloads/code/2015-05-20-vagrant-powered-perforce/provision_always.sh'>download</a></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/bash -x</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">P4PORT</span><span class="o">=</span>tcp4:127.0.0.1:1666
</span><span class='line'>sudo p4d -r /usr/local/p4root <span class="p">&amp;</span>
</span><span class='line'>sleep 3
</span><span class='line'>p4 info
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This script is configured to run at each restart of the virtual machine to make sure that the Perforce server is always started.</p>

<h2>3. Accessing Perforce from host</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth to note that if the second provisioning script is ran with a privileged user
the connection from the host was failing. I took me some time to figure out that starting the perforce server with the non privileged user, is the solution. I didn&rsquo;t understand the reason behind it but I was glad it was working.<br/>
With that in place, the Perforce command line client running on the host machine was able to connect to the Perforce server running on the guest machine with no trouble.</p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/05/14/invest-in-metadata/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-14T22:24:07+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/05/14/invest-in-metadata</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I had a discussion with a colleague about an effort he was making to classify our enterprise wiki content. <br/>
His prime motivation was the difficulty to track what was published, who publishes what and where different information are located.
Thus he was investing in building a directory for the wiki, by providing categorized links to the pages of interest.<br/>
Seeing this, I couldn&rsquo;t agree less.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-14-invest-in-metadata/directory.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, my problem was not with the need but rather with the approach.<br/>
I was as well facing the same problem when trying to look for information in our wiki and persuaded that there is room for improvement.<br/>
Publishing a classified directory of shortcuts was definitely not the right answer. For me, the simple proof resides in the problem statement itself: if we aren&rsquo;t able to track the information how will we be able to maintain an up to date directory? Any human-edited directory is obsolete by design.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-14-invest-in-metadata/obsolete-book.jpg"></p>

<p>Looking back at the evolution of the search engines, one can see how things evolved from static directories to dynamic queries with real-time suggestions.
This also confirms that using static directories is not the right answer.
The problem we want to solve here is not new. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that by now everybody have faced it at least once.<br/>
I had faced it in the past with my e-mails and my photos. For instance, I wanted a quick way to find e-mails related to a certain subject and I needed to group photos by occasion.<br/>
My first attempt was always to classify the data. <br/>
Easy, for e-mails I used folders in my in-box and for photos it was folders on my drive or albums when using a hosting service.
Easy but not free, I had to invest some time to classify the initial stock. For emails automated rules are of great help, for photos it was rather manual (Disclaimer: being a programmer I had scripted the photos&#8217; classification).<br/>
When done, I was rather happy, my data was organized, now I can find what I&rsquo;m looking for easily.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-14-invest-in-metadata/photos-directory-tree.jpg"></p>

<p>Alas, the success was ephemeral. Sometimes I needed to classify an e-mail in several categories. Some other times I needed to find the photos of one of my children for a certain month. My static classification failed me and it wasn&rsquo;t a surprise.
Fortunately for me things had evolved in my favor.
When Google launched their Gmail I was very happy to discover the labels as a replacement of folders. I can tag a mail with one or several labels. Labels can be used as search criteria. Labels were the real answer to my need that I had worked around it using folders. With labels I was able to enrich my e-mails with searchable metadata.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-14-invest-in-metadata/gmail-labels.jpg"></p>

<p>In the digital photography world, two things happened. On one hand, devices evolved, and adding metadata to the photos became the norm (timestamp, gps coordinates, camera model &hellip;). On the other hand, besides taking into account the photo metadata, it become easy to find a photo management tool with a face recognition feature. Thus, it&rsquo;s possible now to look for photos by combining all these information.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-14-invest-in-metadata/picasa-face.jpg"></p>

<p>Taking a step back and looking again at all the cited examples, I can say that it&rsquo;s all about metadata. It&rsquo;s about adding &ldquo;data about the data&rdquo; and making it available for your tools. By exploiting the metadata, tools can offer not only unlimited alternate views, but also slice and dice capabilities.   <br/>
Getting back to our internal wiki problem statement, if you ask me how to solve it, my answer would be to use &ldquo;Semantic Web&rdquo; techniques to enrich the content with metadata, and provide a search engine that can exploit these metadata.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are three practices that I found to be of a great help in my day-to-day work as software development manager.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<h2>Inspection is your friend</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to know how your code source health is.
Complex code tend to have a high maintenance cost and makes entry cost higher for a newcomer. Failing to apply best practices and recommendations can result in various bugs. A poor test coverage makes future development very likely to introduce regressions.<br/>
Static and dynamic analysis are you best friends to give you accurate indicators about your code health. They also help you take appropriate actions to cure the spotted deficiencies.<br/>
If you don&rsquo;t have this yet in place, all it takes is these simple steps:<br/>
1. Start by setting up a continuous code analysis process for your source code<br/>
2. Define a quality profile and break the build whenever the quality gateway is violated<br/>
3. Every time an issue is fixed, adjust the quality gate accordingly</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-13-3-things-every-software-development-manager-should-do/inspection.jpg"></p>

<h2>Better double-check</h2>

<p>Static and dynamic code analysis can help you track the source code health but when it comes to technical design they are rather limited.<br/>
When software development manager drifts away from the code because of other duties that require his attention, code review can be a good help.<br/>
By reviewing the changes regularly the software development manager can stay up to date with the design changes and can intervene at an early stage if needed.
How to do it? By a continuous automated code review generation process:<br/>
1. Automatically create a code review for each new change<br/>
2. Keep the pace, perform the review regularly</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-13-3-things-every-software-development-manager-should-do/diff.jpg"></p>

<h2>Get your hands dirty</h2>

<p>Quite often the software development manager doesn&rsquo;t have room anymore for coding. Unfortunately this can make him unaware of the coding conditions, pain-points and other important factors. If the team fail to give him a comprehensive feedback this can result in negative outcomes. <br/>
My suggestion, make room to code. Besides giving you an accurate idea of the work conditions of your team, you&rsquo;ll enjoy performing what initially made you want this job.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you get stuck in the traffic jam everyday while commuting to work?<br/>
Would you like to make use of this wasted time? Read on.<br/>
I usually spend a couple of hours commuting to/from work every day.<br/>
Sitting behind my steering wheel listening to the radio was not very rewarding.  <br/>
So I started exploring how I could better invest this lost time.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>
From among the things I tried, these are the once that worked well.</p>

<h3>1. <a href="https://librivox.org/">LibriVox</a></h3>

<p>LibriVox brings you free recordings of books available in the public domain.
You can listen to free audio books from any connected device or even burn them onto a CD.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://librivox.org/images/librivox-logo.png"></p>

<h3>2.  Commercial audio books</h3>

<p>If the book you&rsquo;re interesting in is not in the public domain, you might find a commercial audio version. Either on CD or a downloadable one, there are a lot of offers out <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=audio+books">there</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-05-5-things-you-can-try-to-get-back-wasted-commute-time/audio-book.png"></p>

<h3>3. <a href="https://www.ted.com/">Ted Talks</a></h3>

<p>Listen to free talks on a large variety of subjects. Whatever your interest is, there&rsquo;s a chance you find interesting and inspiring talks on the subject.
Ted app let you download the talks for offline viewing.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-05-5-things-you-can-try-to-get-back-wasted-commute-time/ted.png"></p>

<h3>4. Online courses</h3>

<p>If it happens that you&rsquo;re following an online course, you can make use of the commute time to listen to the courses videos. Most of the platforms let you download the videos for offline viewing. Efficiency of this approach will depend on how much you need your eyes on the screen to understand the content.
What worked for me was listening to the video while commuting, and then reading the slides once back home.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-05-5-things-you-can-try-to-get-back-wasted-commute-time/moocs.jpg"></p>

<h3>5. Google Play Books Reader</h3>

<p>You can make use of the Text-to-speech for Google Play content to read e-books.
For this you need to activate the &ldquo;Read aloud&rdquo; option form the top menu.
It only works with EPUB files, and I recommend activating the &ldquo;High quality voice&rdquo; option for a better listening experience.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my spare time, I like to try and learn new software technologies.
For this I use my Windows laptop. The problem is that after several cycles of installing and removing stuff, the laptop become slow. Its performance keep degrading with time until I take some time to reset its installation and reconfigure things.</p>

<p>Recently, after struggling with ruby installation on Windows I decided to reconsider Linux. Since I needed windows for other reasons, I decided to try using virtualization. I started by using <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> to configure a Linux guest machine. While discussing this with a friend, he suggested trying <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I visited <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> website and it immediately got my attention for its simplicity. All you need is a configuration file, a small set of commands and the virtual machine is up an running.<br/>
Playing around with Vagrant tutorial lead me to the idea of creating a sandbox for each software development experiment or project I work on.</p>

<p>I decided to test the idea of this sandbox on my next project: this blog.<br/>
As many software developers I settled on using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>/<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for my blog.<br/>
For this purpose, I needed a Linux machine with the required tools installed and a synced copy of the blog source. After several iteration I got to a stage where I&rsquo;m able to edit the blog from any computer connected to the internet. <br/>
In three steps I&rsquo;m able to deploy a blog sandbox and start blogging:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, install required tools: <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> and <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>.</li>
<li>Second, clone the blog repository,</li>
<li>Finally, start the sandbox by switching to its directory and running Vagrant up</li>
</ol>


<p>It took me some time to get to a simple and repeatable process.
I&rsquo;m glad of the results as I&rsquo;m using the sandbox to publish this post. This experiment showed me the real benefits from using <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ll be using it in future projects.</p>

<p>Although this post is not intended to be a tutorial on how to use <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> or <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, I&rsquo;m going to mention a couple of things I found interesting. I&rsquo;ll also write about some difficulties I encountered and how I solved them.</p>

<h3>What I liked most</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy X11 forwarding over SSH connections</strong> by adding <code>config.ssh.forward_x11 = true</code> to Vagranfile. With <a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/">MobaXterm</a> running on my Windows host I was able to display the guest.</li>
<li><strong>Easy port forwarding</strong> by adding <code>config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 4000, host: 4000</code> all traffic network to the port 4000 on the host machine, was actually forwarded to the guest machine on the specified port.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/">Vagrant synced folder</a></strong> enables editing the files from both the guest and the host.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What took me some time to figure out</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shell provisioner as <code>vagrant</code> user</strong> and not as root: using <code>privileged false</code> in Vagrantfile didn&rsquo;t work for me when setting local version of Ruby via rbenv. I finally settled on chaining a call to a script with the specified user <code>su -c "source /vagrant/vagrant/user-config.sh" vagrant</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blog preview only accessible from guest</strong>, at first I thought it was a problem with port forwarding, but finally, after tedious searches on the internet, I found out that binding the server to 0.0.0.0 in Rakefile was the solution. <br/>
<code>server_host     = "0.0.0.0"   # server bind address for preview server</code><br/>
<code>rackupPid = Process.spawn("rackup --host #{server_host} --port #{server_port}")</code></p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;re interessted in trying, the complete configuration is available in the  <a href="https://github.com/bil-t/octopress-vagrant-setup">octopress-vagrant-setup</a> github repository.</p>
