    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just one full week in my new job, that&rsquo;s what it took me  to experience a new kind of sport, the &ldquo;Meeting Run&rdquo;.<br/>
And as a good friend of mine would say, like everything there are always two sides. <br/>
In what I experienced I encountered a good one and a bad one (and no there&rsquo;s no <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/">ugly</a> one, at least not yet).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-10-19-beating-the-meeting-run/time.png"></p>

<p>
The good side was that my <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness&amp;hl=fr">Google Fit application</a> started congratulating me everyday for meeting my 1 hour walking goal, and sometimes I would even hit that by noon!</p>

<p>In 15 years in software development, it never happened to me during work days ! (yes I know you might argue that smartphones and activity tracking applications are rather recent, so you&rsquo;ll have to take my word for that).   <br/>
This is great news, I finally managed to exercise and work at the same time, there&rsquo;s a hope for me to loose the kilos I gained this summer!</p>

<p>And as you might suspect there&rsquo;s no free lunch so where&rsquo;s the catch? <br/>
Well here&rsquo;s the bad side ; since all meetings were adjacent, it was just impossible for me to arrive at time to any meeting.<br/>
And it really annoyed me, I always used to do my best to be at most on time if not a couple of minutes before. <br/>
But I admit when I was able to do this my calendar looked a little bit different than it is now.<br/>
The same pattern occurred the whole week, and I started getting calls from people waiting for me in the next meeting.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, this is the end, I said to myself sadly ; bye bye punctuality and welcome reality &hellip;<br/>
Fortunately a little voice in my head was whispering &ldquo;no, no, no&rdquo; and when I paid attention I heard it say &ldquo;&hellip; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken window theory</a> &hellip; <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professionalism/Diane_Vaughan_and_the_normalization_of_deviance">normalization of deviance</a> &hellip;&rdquo;. <br/>
And it just hit me, it was clear to me that I was slipping into these anti-patterns.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-10-19-beating-the-meeting-run/broken-window.png"></p>

<p>Accepting being late to meeting is a clear illustration of &ldquo;Diane Vaughan&rsquo;s normalization of deviance&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Social normalization of deviance means that people within the organization become so much accustomed to a deviant behavior that they don&rsquo;t consider it as deviant, <br/>
despite the fact that they far exceed their own rules for the elementary safety&rdquo;. People grow more accustom to the deviant behavior the more it occurs. To people outside of the organization, <br/>
the activities seem deviant; however, people within the organization do not recognize the deviance because it is seem as a normal occurrence. <br/>
In hindsight, people within the organization realize that their seemingly normal behavior was deviant.</p></blockquote>

<p>And worse, it&rsquo;s the first broken window I&rsquo;m inviting to my work habits. What next, I&rsquo;ll start accepting code with less quality, shipping untested code to production, and end up considering compiler warnings as just normal messages! <br/>
NO, NO, NO, this is not an option. <br/>
But how to avoid that?  How to avoid adjacent meetings? One might be tempted by defining a process to manage his calendar.  <br/>
And start thinking about rules, like meetings should not be adjacent, or they should never be scheduled to start at hh:00 but rather hh:05.<br/>
But how to enforce that, you might think about developing an outlook extension for that &hellip; <br/>
That was really compelling for the software engineer in me, but for the pragmatic developer it looked complex and too much, it also required everybody to be aligned with the rules when booking meetings.  <br/>
I needed something that I can achieve on my own, where I have full control to apply it, something that would be simple.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-10-19-beating-the-meeting-run/punctuality.png"></p>

<p>Suddenly it all became clear. The solution is simple, do like the <a href="https://www.bitcoinmining.com/">Bitcoin miner</a>. A Bitcoin miner will keep a small fee for himself when validating a transaction.<br/>
All I have to do is the same, I&rsquo;ll just apply a tax to the meeting time and take 5 minutes for me.<br/>
This will let me leave the meeting 5 minutes early, of course I&rsquo;ll inform people at the start that I&rsquo;ll be leaving early.<br/>
And that&rsquo;s it ! A simple and actionable solution.  <br/>
Abiding by this rule I will hopefully get back punctuality and avoid annoying people by arriving late to meetings.</p>

<p><strong>So from now on, if you&rsquo;re in a meeting with me, be advised, there&rsquo;s a fee, I&rsquo;ll be leaving 5 minutes early!  </strong></p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/09/20/agile-retrospectives-using-trello/"/>
    <updated>2015-09-20T20:31:53+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/09/20/agile-retrospectives-using-trello</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a distributed agile team working from Paris and Beirut, remote retrospectives are part of our rituals.<br/>
To conduct these remote retrospectives, we have settled on using <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>. <br/>
My colleague <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/">BOURGAU Philippe</a> has <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/">blogged on what we tried</a> and how we ended up by opting for Trello.<br/>
Since then we have made some improvements on speeding up the meeting preparation, and I think it&rsquo;s time to share them.
<img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-09-20-agile-retrospectives-using-trello/trello.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As you might know, retrospectives activities are recurrent, it&rsquo;s not unlikely to redo the same activity a couple of retrospectives later.<br/>
So it was natural for us to start creating boards to be used as templates for the activities. <br/>
These boards served as a starting point when setting up a session and were improved continuously. <br/>
So how is this used practically ?<br/>
<img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-09-20-agile-retrospectives-using-trello/gald-sad-mad.png">
In our case, a facilitator is responsible of preparing and animating each session. <br/>
When preparing the session, instead of creating each activity board from scratch, the facilitator had now a catalog in which he could choose the activities. <br/>
All he had to do is to copy the board, give him a specific name and share it with the team. <br/>
Each board contains a short description of the activity, and a suitable setup to conduct it.<br/>
In reality the facilitator still created boards from scratch, but only when no template was available.<br/>
But now, instead of doing it only for his session, he took the time to first create a template and then copy it into his session. <br/>
This way he would have contributed to the enrichment of the catalog and facilitated the preparation of upcoming sessions. <br/>
We&rsquo;ve been doing this for quite some time and I think it&rsquo;s worth to share it with the agile community. <br/>
We&rsquo;ve learned a lot form others&#8217; experiments and it&rsquo;s time for us to contribute back with what we experimented.  <br/>
I&rsquo;ve started publishing some of the templates I made to the <a href="https://trello.com/agileretrospectives">Agile Retrospectives</a> space, it&rsquo;s a public Trello team.
As I&rsquo;m writing this post, there are six published templates. I&rsquo;ll soon be asking other contributors on the team to share their work too, so stay tuned for more templates. <br/>
I hope you will find this useful for your retrospectives, and if you do use a template and have any improvement to make, don&rsquo;t hesitate to join the <a href="https://trello.com/agileretrospectives">team</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/09/11/making-your-xoom-2-kid-safe/"/>
    <updated>2015-09-11T21:08:35+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/09/11/making-your-xoom-2-kid-safe</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of years ago I bought the Motorola Xoom 2 for my personal usage.<br/>
It was my first Android tablet and I mainly planned to use it to make Skype calls, browse the Internet and read some e-books.
We also used it to play nursery rhyme videos to our last-born.   <br/>
As he grew, he was convinced that it was &ldquo;his&rdquo; tablet and started to play games on it.<br/>
It didn&rsquo;t take him long to figure out how to look for YouTube videos or to install new games, this is when troubles started.
     <img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-09-11-making-your-xoom-2-kid-safe/Xoom2.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It was clear for us that, unless we wanted to constantly supervise him while using the tablet, we needed a strict parental control.<br/>
The parental control is not built-in in the Xoom 2, but a lot of options are available in Google Play.<br/>
Options varies from locking apps, to safe browsers, and screen time management apps.</p>

<p>After trying some different strategies this is what I found most suitable.</p>

<p>I first rooted the tablet in order to install an ad blocker. I chose to do this because most of the free games have pop-up ads.<br/>
Beside being annoying, they are difficult for kids to skip. Most of the time the lead my kid to some content that I do not approve.</p>

<p>Then I installed <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiddoware.kidsplace">Kids Place - Parental Control</a> from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=kiddoware">kiddoware</a>.  <br/>
Beside restricting the kids to apps you have approved, Kids Place can be configured to override the &lsquo;home&rsquo; button and to run on tablet boot.<br/>
Additional plugins such as a safe video player, safe browser and screen time management can be installed too.
    <img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-09-11-making-your-xoom-2-kid-safe/Xoom2-Kids-Place.png">
With this configuration the Xoom 2 became a child safe Android tablet that I was confident to leave in my kid&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in rooting your Xoom 2, here&rsquo;s the steps to follow:<br/>
1. On tablet go to Settings -> Developers Options and enable the Usb Debugging option.      <br/>
2. On tablet go to Settings -> Security and enable Unknown Sources option. <br/>
2. Plug your tablet to your PC, check the device manager to make sure the driver is properly installed.<br/>
If you see a yellow exclamation mark next to the Xoom 2 driver, right-click on it, go to &lsquo;Driver&rsquo; tab, click &lsquo;Update Driver&rsquo;, click &lsquo;Browse my computer &hellip;&rsquo;, click the &lsquo;Let me pick &hellip;&rsquo;<br/>
From the list choose the &lsquo;Android ADB Composite Driver&rsquo;<br/>
    <img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-09-11-making-your-xoom-2-kid-safe/adb-driver.png">  <br/>
3. Download and unzip <a href="https://github.com/bil-t/android-utils/blob/master/Xoom2-IceCreamSandwich-RootFiles.zip?raw=true">Xoom2-IceCreamSandwich-RootFiles</a><br/>
4. Run DroidRazrRoot404.bat<br/>
5. Your tablet will reboot and you will have gained root access.</p>

<p>To block ads do the following:<br/>
1. download and install <a href="https://github.com/bil-t/android-utils/blob/master/AdAway-release_Build-Oct.13.2014.apk?raw=true">AdAway</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/bil-t/android-utils/blob/master/adblockplusandroid-1.3.apk?raw=true">AdBlockPlus</a><br/>
2. Grant both apps root privileges when it&rsquo;s asked for.</p>

<p>Now you&rsquo;re ready to install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiddoware.kidsplace">Kids Place - Parental Control</a> and make your tablet safer for kids.</p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/07/23/unlock-full-android-power-to-your-amazon-fire-hd-6/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-23T21:33:43+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/07/23/unlock-full-android-power-to-your-amazon-fire-hd-6</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently acquired an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KC6I06S/ref=ods_fs_far">Amazon Fire HD 6</a> tablet.<br/>
I had high hopes that it would be the perfect tablet to read books, use <a href="www.skype.com">Skype</a> and check mails.<br/>
I found its price attractive with respect to its characteristics, and being an old customer of Amazon I was confident that the tablet will meet my expectations.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-07-23-unlock-full-android-power-to-your-amazon-fire-hd-6/fire-gapps.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It was no surprise to me to find out that the Fire HD 6 had only access to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Store/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=133140011">Kindle Store</a>. My unpleasant surprise was discovering that <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5700313618786177705&amp;hl=fr">Google applications</a> are not available in the Amazon store.</p>

<p>Using the Fire HD 6 without the Gmail, Hangout, Drive and other google applications was not an option for me.<br/>
Knowing that the Fire HD 6 is running Android, I started looking for a way to install the Google Apps.</p>

<p>There are a lot of information on how to root the Fire HD 6 and install Google applications, unfortunately all resources are not up to date or detailed enough. It took me some time to figure it out, and after two attempts, I managed to get everything working perfectly. Here are the detailed steps that helped me get there.</p>

<p>To install Google application you need root access to the tablet.<br/>
In order to get root access the Fire HD 6 must be running the Fire OS 4.5.3 or below.  <br/>
If you, being an enthusiast like me, have upgraded you tablet OS as soon as you received it you will have to apply the following steps to downgrade back to Fire OS 4.5.3. If you&rsquo;re already running 4.5.3 skip to step 4.</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the Fire OS 5.0 developer preview

<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/platforms/android-fireos?sc_channel=EM&amp;sc_campaign=FireOSPreview&amp;sc_%20detail=GetPreview">Fire OS Developer Preview</a></li>
<li>Press the yellow <code>developer preview</code> button on the right side of the page</li>
<li>Log into your amazon account</li>
<li>Choose your device</li>
<li>Go to system settings/device options/system updates and press the check for updates button</li>
<li>Follow the instruction and complete the update</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/community/post/Tx3RZFBU0KJTSWS/Setting-up-the-ADB-Driver-for-Kindle-Fire-Devices">Set up ADB on your computer and enable ADB on your tablet</a>

<ul>
<li>Installtion of the ADB driver on my windows 8.1 didn&rsquo;t work well. The trick that worked for me was to delete the Fire device from the device manger and to manually add an android ADB composite driver.
<img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-07-23-unlock-full-android-power-to-your-amazon-fire-hd-6/android-adb.png"></li>

    <updated>2015-07-13T19:13:30+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/07/13/turn-your-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago, while participating to an off-site workshop, a colleague wanted to show a new mobile application prototype.</p>

<p>For this purpose he needed a phone to reach both the internet and a laptop hooked to the local network. <br/>
Since wireless connection was not available the demo was at risk.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The laptop was running windows, equipped with a wireless network card and connected via ethernet to a LAN that gave it internet access.<br/>
With that in mind, it occurred to me that making the wireless card act as an access point could be the answer.<br/>
Searching the web I was able to find out how to achieve this by using the Microsoft Virtual WiFi mini port adapter, available on both windows 7 and 8.</p>

<p>I recently re-used the same technique to watch movies served from my laptop using a raspberry pie with a usb wireless Lan adapter.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to setup the Microsoft Virtual WiFi mini port adapter in simple steps.</p>

<p>First you need to run a command line with administrator privileges:</p>

<ol>
<li>Locate the &ldquo;Command prompt&rdquo; program (Click Start, click All Programs, and then click Accessories under windows 7 or in the Start Search box, type cmd under windows 8)</li>
<li>Right-click &ldquo;Command prompt&rdquo;, and then click Run as administrator.</li>
</ol>


<p>Then you need to setup a virtual wifi by running the following command:</p>

<p><code>netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=your_wifi_name key=your_wifi_password keyUsage=persistent</code></p>

<p>Replace your_wifi_name by the name of your network and &lsquo;your_wifi_password&rsquo; by the password you want users to connect with.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-07-13-turn-your-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/cmd-1.png"></p>

<p>Then type the following command to start the hosted network:</p>

<p><code>netsh wlan start hostednetwork</code></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-07-13-turn-your-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/cmd-2.png"></p>

<p>Now all is left to do is to enable the internet sharing for this you need to got to &lsquo;Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Network and Sharing Center&rsquo; right click the newly created virtual wifi adapter, choose properties, click on the sharing tab, click the first check box and choose the appropriate networking connection:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-07-13-turn-your-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/settings-1.png"><br/>
<img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-07-13-turn-your-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/settings-2.png"></p>

<p>To check the status of your hosted network use the command:</p>

<p><code>netsh wlan show hostednetwork</code></p>

<p>It will tell you information like the used channel as well as the number of connected clients.</p>

<p>Finally to stop the hosted network use the command:</p>

<p><code>netsh wlan stop hostednetwork</code></p>

    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/06/21/custom-scrolling-with-meteor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve recently tried using <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> to build a web application.<br/>
I used <a href="https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router">Iron.Router</a> to configure the different routes of the web application. Everything worked fine out of the box until I started using links with fragment identifiers.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First thing I wanted to add was an animated scroll behavior when navigating between anchors on the same page.<br/>
I was able to achieve this by overriding the <code>scrollToHash-function</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span> (animated-scroll.js)</span> <a href='http://bilal.eltayara.net/downloads/code/2015-06-21-custom-scrolling-with-meteor/animated-scroll.js'>download</a></figcaption>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">Router</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">_scrollToHash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">hash</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">section</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">hash</span><span class="p">);</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>Next I noticed that when scrolling in a page and then navigating to a new one, the scroll remained at its last position.<br/>
The user experience was not acceptable.  When navigating to a new page, the user expects to land on top of the page and not somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>To fix this behavior I used the Iron.Router <a href="https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router/blob/devel/Guide.md#hooks">hooks</a>.
I added a global hook that scrolls to the top of the page after the routing.<br/>
This can be achieved by adding the following code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span> (scroll-to-top.js)</span> <a href='http://bilal.eltayara.net/downloads/code/2015-06-21-custom-scrolling-with-meteor/scroll-to-top.js'>download</a></figcaption>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">IR_AfterHooks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>With these two customizations I was able to have a nice scrolling user experience with my meteor application. <br/>
What about you, do you have interesting customization to share ?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently wanted to try <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> and explore its features.
For this I chose to install it an all its dependencies in a Vagrant box.<br/>
I followed the official <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">install instructions</a> and automated everything in provisioning shell scripts.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-30-setting-up-wordpress-on-a-vagrant-box/vagrant+wordpress.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Running <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> requires a web server, php support and a <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database.<br/>
I chose use <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> as the box operating system. As a web server I chose to use the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP Server</a>.</p>

<p>My provisioning strategy consisted of two shell scripts.
The first script called provision_once.sh is run only upon the box creation, and has privileged user rights. The second script called provision_always.sh is ran each time the box starts with a non privileged user rights.<br/>
This is specified in the Vagrant configuration file as follows:</p>

<pre><code>config.vm.provision "shell", path: "vagrant/provision_once.sh"
config.vm.provision "shell", path: "vagrant/provision_always.sh", run: "always", privileged: "false"  
</code></pre>

<p>The first part of provision_once.sh script installs required dependencies listed above:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get -qq -y update
apt-get -qq -y install apache2
apt-get -qq -y install php5 
apt-get -qq -y install php5-mysq  
</code></pre>

<p>After installing the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> server, I needed to configure it, and create the required <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> database.<br/>
To setup the root password for the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> server in attended way, one can use debconf-set-selections as shown below. I chose to go with no password as I was setting this up just for test purposes. <br/>
But this would have been too simple, as I expected the unexpected happened. The installation of the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> server didn&rsquo;t go as planned. The <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> server was failing to start. The failure was only happening upon the box creation, doing manually the same steps was installing the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> server correctly.<br/>
After several attempts the only workaround I found was to perform the installation twice in the provisioning script:</p>

<pre><code>for i in {1..2}  
do
    debconf-set-selections &lt;&lt;&lt; 'mysql-server mysql-server/root_password password '  
    debconf-set-selections &lt;&lt;&lt; 'mysql-server mysql-server/root_password_again password '  
    apt-get -qq -y install mysql-server  
done  
</code></pre>

<p>Creating the database is rather straight forward using the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> command-line tool:</p>

<pre><code>mysql -uroot -e "CREATE DATABASE $DBNAME"
mysql -uroot -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON $DBNAME.* to '$DBUSER'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$DBPASSWD'"  
mysql -uroot -e "FLUSH PRIVILEGES"
</code></pre>

<p>Next I needed to automate the download and the configuration of the Wordpress instance.<br/>
The part shown below will download and expand the latest <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> version from the official site.  It&rsquo;ll also configure <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> to use the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database created earlier and generate the required authentication salts.</p>

<pre><code>cd /vagrant
wget -q https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz 
rm -f latest.tar.gz
cd wordpress
cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php   
sed -i.bak -u "s/database_name_here/$DBNAME/g" wp-config.php
sed -i.bak -u "s/username_here/$DBUSER/g" wp-config.php
sed -i.bak -u "s/password_here/$DBPASSWD/g" wp-config.php   
for i in {1..8}
do
    NEW_UUID=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 64 | head -n 1)
    sed -i.bak -u "0,/put your unique phrase here/s//$NEW_UUID/" wp-config.php      
done
</code></pre>

<p>Finally I needed to point the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP Server</a> to the <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> site, this can be achieved as follows:</p>

<pre><code>sed -i.bak -u 's,/var/www/html,/vagrant/wordpress,g' /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

echo '&lt;Directory /vagrant/wordpress&gt;' &gt;&gt; /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
echo '  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks' &gt;&gt; /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
echo '  AllowOverride None' &gt;&gt; /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
echo '  Require all granted' &gt;&gt; /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
echo '&lt;/Directory&gt;' &gt;&gt; /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

service apache2 restart
</code></pre>

<p>The provision always script is simple, it just make sure that the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> is up running upon the box start-up.</p>

<pre><code>if [[ ! "$(sudo service mysql status)" =~ "start/running" ]]
then
    sudo service mysql start
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Finally redirecting the port 80 to the host, makes the <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> instance accessible from the browser, and ready to use.</p>

<p>After attending the <a href="https://open.hpi.de/courses/softwareanalytics2015/" title="Automated Visual Software Analytics">Automated Visual Software Analytics </a> online course I had an idea on computing some new metrics deduced from the VCS (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control" title="VCS">Version Control System</a>).</p>

<p>Since I want to make use of these metrics at work, my implementation should be
able to work against a <a href="http://www.perforce.com/" title="Perforce.com">Perforce</a> server, the VCS we mainly use.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In order to have the appropriate development environment I needed a Linux virtual machine on which Perforce is installed, configured an running properly.
I had previously used <a href="blog/2015/05/01/an-octopress-slash-vagrant-experiment/" title="An Octopress/Vagrant Experiment">Vagrant</a> to sandbox a development environment, and at that moment I knew it was the beginning of a long-term addiction.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, Perforce can be downloaded free for up to 20 users.<br/>
My goal was to configure a virtual machine via Vagrant and provision it by installing a perforce server, running it and make it accessible from the host machine.</p>

<p>Interested ? Here&rsquo;s how to do it.</p>

<p>Since I was already using a Vagrant virtual machine I had to pay attention to using a different set of ports.
The SSH port forwarding is bound, out of the box, to 2222. It was not clear in the documentation how to disable it. After several attempts and some googling I ended up by finding the right way to do it. For it to work you need to add the following two entries in the Vagrant file:</p>

<p><code>config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 22, host: 2222, id: "ssh", disabled: true</code>  <br/>
<code>config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 22, host: 2223, auto_correct: true</code></p>

<p>Perforce uses by default the port 1666, I chose to use the same port when forwarding it to the host.</p>

<h2>2. Provisioning: Installing and starting Perfoce</h2>

<p>Next I had to install perforce and run it. I was lucky enough to stumble upon an article that revealed to me the existence of a public Perforce FTP server.</p>

<p>Knowing that, I used a first provisioning shell script to download the perforce server binary (p4d) and its command line client (p4).</p>

<p>A second provisioning script, executed with a non privileged user, starts the Perforce server and does a connection attempt.</p>

<p>This script is configured to run at each restart of the virtual machine to make sure that the Perforce server is always started.</p>

<h2>3. Accessing Perforce from host</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth to note that if the second provisioning script is ran with a privileged user
the connection from the host was failing. I took me some time to figure out that starting the perforce server with the non privileged user, is the solution. I didn&rsquo;t understand the reason behind it but I was glad it was working.<br/>
With that in place, the Perforce command line client running on the host machine was able to connect to the Perforce server running on the guest machine with no trouble.</p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/05/14/invest-in-metadata/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-14T22:24:07+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/05/14/invest-in-metadata</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I had a discussion with a colleague about an effort he was making to classify our enterprise wiki content. <br/>
His prime motivation was the difficulty to track what was published, who publishes what and where different information are located.
Thus he was investing in building a directory for the wiki, by providing categorized links to the pages of interest.<br/>
Seeing this, I couldn&rsquo;t agree less.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-14-invest-in-metadata/directory.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, my problem was not with the need but rather with the approach.<br/>
I was as well facing the same problem when trying to look for information in our wiki and persuaded that there is room for improvement.<br/>
Publishing a classified directory of shortcuts was definitely not the right answer. For me, the simple proof resides in the problem statement itself: if we aren&rsquo;t able to track the information how will we be able to maintain an up to date directory? Any human-edited directory is obsolete by design.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-14-invest-in-metadata/obsolete-book.jpg"></p>

<p>Looking back at the evolution of the search engines, one can see how things evolved from static directories to dynamic queries with real-time suggestions.
This also confirms that using static directories is not the right answer.
The problem we want to solve here is not new. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that by now everybody have faced it at least once.<br/>
I had faced it in the past with my e-mails and my photos. For instance, I wanted a quick way to find e-mails related to a certain subject and I needed to group photos by occasion.<br/>
My first attempt was always to classify the data. <br/>
Easy, for e-mails I used folders in my in-box and for photos it was folders on my drive or albums when using a hosting service.
Easy but not free, I had to invest some time to classify the initial stock. For emails automated rules are of great help, for photos it was rather manual (Disclaimer: being a programmer I had scripted the photos&#8217; classification).<br/>
When done, I was rather happy, my data was organized, now I can find what I&rsquo;m looking for easily.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-14-invest-in-metadata/photos-directory-tree.jpg"></p>

<p>Alas, the success was ephemeral. Sometimes I needed to classify an e-mail in several categories. Some other times I needed to find the photos of one of my children for a certain month. My static classification failed me and it wasn&rsquo;t a surprise.
Fortunately for me things had evolved in my favor.
When Google launched their Gmail I was very happy to discover the labels as a replacement of folders. I can tag a mail with one or several labels. Labels can be used as search criteria. Labels were the real answer to my need that I had worked around it using folders. With labels I was able to enrich my e-mails with searchable metadata.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-14-invest-in-metadata/gmail-labels.jpg"></p>

<p>In the digital photography world, two things happened. On one hand, devices evolved, and adding metadata to the photos became the norm (timestamp, gps coordinates, camera model &hellip;). On the other hand, besides taking into account the photo metadata, it become easy to find a photo management tool with a face recognition feature. Thus, it&rsquo;s possible now to look for photos by combining all these information.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-14-invest-in-metadata/picasa-face.jpg"></p>

<p>Taking a step back and looking again at all the cited examples, I can say that it&rsquo;s all about metadata. It&rsquo;s about adding &ldquo;data about the data&rdquo; and making it available for your tools. By exploiting the metadata, tools can offer not only unlimited alternate views, but also slice and dice capabilities.   <br/>
Getting back to our internal wiki problem statement, if you ask me how to solve it, my answer would be to use &ldquo;Semantic Web&rdquo; techniques to enrich the content with metadata, and provide a search engine that can exploit these metadata.</p>

    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/05/13/3-things-every-software-development-manager-should-do</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are three practices that I found to be of a great help in my day-to-day work as software development manager.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<h2>Inspection is your friend</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to know how your code source health is.
Complex code tend to have a high maintenance cost and makes entry cost higher for a newcomer. Failing to apply best practices and recommendations can result in various bugs. A poor test coverage makes future development very likely to introduce regressions.<br/>
Static and dynamic analysis are you best friends to give you accurate indicators about your code health. They also help you take appropriate actions to cure the spotted deficiencies.<br/>
If you don&rsquo;t have this yet in place, all it takes is these simple steps:<br/>
1. Start by setting up a continuous code analysis process for your source code<br/>
2. Define a quality profile and break the build whenever the quality gateway is violated<br/>
3. Every time an issue is fixed, adjust the quality gate accordingly</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-13-3-things-every-software-development-manager-should-do/inspection.jpg"></p>

<h2>Better double-check</h2>

<p>Static and dynamic code analysis can help you track the source code health but when it comes to technical design they are rather limited.<br/>
When software development manager drifts away from the code because of other duties that require his attention, code review can be a good help.<br/>
By reviewing the changes regularly the software development manager can stay up to date with the design changes and can intervene at an early stage if needed.
How to do it? By a continuous automated code review generation process:<br/>
1. Automatically create a code review for each new change<br/>
2. Keep the pace, perform the review regularly</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-13-3-things-every-software-development-manager-should-do/diff.jpg"></p>

<h2>Get your hands dirty</h2>

<p>Quite often the software development manager doesn&rsquo;t have room anymore for coding. Unfortunately this can make him unaware of the coding conditions, pain-points and other important factors. If the team fail to give him a comprehensive feedback this can result in negative outcomes. <br/>
My suggestion, make room to code. Besides giving you an accurate idea of the work conditions of your team, you&rsquo;ll enjoy performing what initially made you want this job.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you get stuck in the traffic jam everyday while commuting to work?<br/>
Would you like to make use of this wasted time? Read on.<br/>
I usually spend a couple of hours commuting to/from work every day.<br/>
Sitting behind my steering wheel listening to the radio was not very rewarding.  <br/>
So I started exploring how I could better invest this lost time.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>
From among the things I tried, these are the once that worked well.</p>

<h3>1. <a href="https://librivox.org/">LibriVox</a></h3>

<p>LibriVox brings you free recordings of books available in the public domain.
You can listen to free audio books from any connected device or even burn them onto a CD.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://librivox.org/images/librivox-logo.png"></p>

<h3>2.  Commercial audio books</h3>

<p>If the book you&rsquo;re interesting in is not in the public domain, you might find a commercial audio version. Either on CD or a downloadable one, there are a lot of offers out <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=audio+books">there</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-05-5-things-you-can-try-to-get-back-wasted-commute-time/audio-book.png"></p>

<h3>3. <a href="https://www.ted.com/">Ted Talks</a></h3>

<p>Listen to free talks on a large variety of subjects. Whatever your interest is, there&rsquo;s a chance you find interesting and inspiring talks on the subject.
Ted app let you download the talks for offline viewing.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-05-5-things-you-can-try-to-get-back-wasted-commute-time/ted.png"></p>

<h3>4. Online courses</h3>

<p>If it happens that you&rsquo;re following an online course, you can make use of the commute time to listen to the courses videos. Most of the platforms let you download the videos for offline viewing. Efficiency of this approach will depend on how much you need your eyes on the screen to understand the content.
What worked for me was listening to the video while commuting, and then reading the slides once back home.</p>

<h3>5. Google Play Books Reader</h3>

<p>You can make use of the Text-to-speech for Google Play content to read e-books.
For this you need to activate the &ldquo;Read aloud&rdquo; option form the top menu.
It only works with EPUB files, and I recommend activating the &ldquo;High quality voice&rdquo; option for a better listening experience.</p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/05/01/an-octopress-slash-vagrant-experiment/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-01T22:52:06+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/05/01/an-octopress-slash-vagrant-experiment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my spare time, I like to try and learn new software technologies.
For this I use my Windows laptop. The problem is that after several cycles of installing and removing stuff, the laptop become slow. Its performance keep degrading with time until I take some time to reset its installation and reconfigure things.</p>

<p>Recently, after struggling with ruby installation on Windows I decided to reconsider Linux. Since I needed windows for other reasons, I decided to try using virtualization. I started by using <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> to configure a Linux guest machine. While discussing this with a friend, he suggested trying <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I visited <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> website and it immediately got my attention for its simplicity. All you need is a configuration file, a small set of commands and the virtual machine is up an running.<br/>
Playing around with Vagrant tutorial lead me to the idea of creating a sandbox for each software development experiment or project I work on.</p>

<p>I decided to test the idea of this sandbox on my next project: this blog.<br/>
As many software developers I settled on using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>/<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for my blog.<br/>
For this purpose, I needed a Linux machine with the required tools installed and a synced copy of the blog source. After several iteration I got to a stage where I&rsquo;m able to edit the blog from any computer connected to the internet. <br/>
In three steps I&rsquo;m able to deploy a blog sandbox and start blogging:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, install required tools: <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> and <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>.</li>
<li>Second, clone the blog repository,</li>
<li>Finally, start the sandbox by switching to its directory and running Vagrant up</li>
</ol>


<p>It took me some time to get to a simple and repeatable process.
I&rsquo;m glad of the results as I&rsquo;m using the sandbox to publish this post. This experiment showed me the real benefits from using <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ll be using it in future projects.</p>

<p>Although this post is not intended to be a tutorial on how to use <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> or <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, I&rsquo;m going to mention a couple of things I found interesting. I&rsquo;ll also write about some difficulties I encountered and how I solved them.</p>

<h3>What I liked most</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy X11 forwarding over SSH connections</strong> by adding <code>config.ssh.forward_x11 = true</code> to Vagranfile. With <a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/">MobaXterm</a> running on my Windows host I was able to display the guest.</li>
<li><strong>Easy port forwarding</strong> by adding <code>config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 4000, host: 4000</code> all traffic network to the port 4000 on the host machine, was actually forwarded to the guest machine on the specified port.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/">Vagrant synced folder</a></strong> enables editing the files from both the guest and the host.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What took me some time to figure out</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shell provisioner as <code>vagrant</code> user</strong> and not as root: using <code>privileged false</code> in Vagrantfile didn&rsquo;t work for me when setting local version of Ruby via rbenv. I finally settled on chaining a call to a script with the specified user <code>su -c "source /vagrant/vagrant/user-config.sh" vagrant</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blog preview only accessible from guest</strong>, at first I thought it was a problem with port forwarding, but finally, after tedious searches on the internet, I found out that binding the server to 0.0.0.0 in Rakefile was the solution. <br/>
<code>server_host     = "0.0.0.0"   # server bind address for preview server</code><br/>
<code>rackupPid = Process.spawn("rackup --host #{server_host} --port #{server_port}")</code></p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;re interessted in trying, the complete configuration is available in the  <a href="https://github.com/bil-t/octopress-vagrant-setup">octopress-vagrant-setup</a> github repository.</p>
