    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I came across the Coursera&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning How To Lean</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a>
while checking the list of the <a href="https://www.onlinecoursereport.com/the-50-most-popular-moocs-of-all-time/">50 most popular Moocs of alltime</a>.
On that list, Oakley’s MOOC was at the number one position. I was a bit
surprised at first to see this kind of MOOC being the most popular, but after a
second thought my surprise vanished. After all, isn’t the audience attending
MOOCs supposed to be genuinely interested in learning? In some way that was a
confirmation.</p>

<p>Beside the fact that it caught my attention, the title intrigued me. For the
past years, I’ve never stopped learning new things every day, and my interest in
learning has only grown more with time. I believe life to be a journey full of
an infinite amount of learning, and the challenge reside in learning the right
thing, in the right way. The MOOC seemed to unlock the secret on becoming an
effective learner, and that was more than enough for me to enroll.</p>

<p>I found the course simple and concise, rather practical with the right amount of
theory to back up the concepts. It explains in a simple way the process of
learning and provides the attendee with techniques and tips in order to apply
the learning. Moreover the way the course is designed make use of the techniques
explained and demonstrate them. Beside making the learning more effective, this
provide the attendees with applied examples of the techniques.</p>

<p>In this post I won&rsquo;t be covering all the course, neither summarizing it. I&rsquo;ll be
just listing my main takeaways hoping it&rsquo;ll be also useful to you to. Regarding
the course itself, I do recommend it to all learners in any domain and any age.I
believe that the techniques and explanation can help anyone in learning more
effectively and easily any topic he&rsquo;s interested in.</p>

<p>In the course you’ll learn about the difference between focused and diffused
modes. When learning a new topic, one usually spends time focusing on the
topic,this is what is known as the focused mode. All learners will recognize
this mode as it’s the common way for learning. On the contrary the diffused mode
is when you let your mind wander not focusing on a specific topic, but rather
giving your brain the space and time to revisit and reinforce what you learned
when in the focused mode. Combination of both focused and diffused modes is
essential for an effective learning.The course introduces the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro technique</a> as a tool to
alternate efficiently between focused mode and short breaks. More importantly,it
invites the learner to look at the learning as a <strong>process</strong> and not as a
product. The product being the goal to learn something, and the process being
how you learn it. When one focuses on the product the goal can quickly become
difficult to achieve. The advised technique is to put in place a process of
cadenced learning sessions, that will help the learner achieve the goal, and
avoid procrastination. By splitting the learning in small chunks, interleaved
with short and long breaks, the learning become effective and achievable. This
approach will also enable the learner to alternate between focused and diffused
modes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_learning_method#Deliberate_practice">Deliberate practice</a>,where
the learner practices everyday for 15 to 20 minutes a certain topic, is an
example of applying this technique.</p>

<p><a href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2018-05-27-my-takeaways-from-barbara-oakleys-learning-how-to-learn/pomodoro-technique.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2018-05-27-my-takeaways-from-barbara-oakleys-learning-how-to-learn/pomodoro-technique.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The course discusses the benefits of exercising a physical activity in improving
the learning. When exercising your body, your brain will be in diffused mode and
will work on reinforcing your learning or generating new ideas.Sleeping is also
an essential activity for learning, it helps the brain reinforce the learning.</p>

<p>When learning, one must pay attention not to fall into the illusion of
competency. Learning something by reading a book or watching a video is not
enough, to avoid the illusion of competency, one must evaluate his learning by
doing tests,asking himself question, that will require him to recall what he
learnt. By doing that, one can improve his learning effectiveness.</p>

<p>Another caveat is overlearning. Repetitive learning of the same thing will not
make a better expert, instead one should aim to deepen his knowledge and
increase the level of difficulty of the exercises, that would improve the
learning. Learning is not just about memorizing things, what makes it effective
is taking the time to understand the why and the how of things. Understanding is
a key ingredient for effective learning. One good way of test your understanding
is to explain what you learned to friends and colleagues. Explaining will not
just help you check your understanding it also a way to recall your learning and
thus makes it more durable.</p>

<p>Metaphors are also a good technique to learn and memorize things, if you enroll
to the course you’ll see a good example on how to use metaphors for effective
learning.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed going through the course, it was the opportunity for me to
learn how to formalize a learning approach and to understand the importance of
the <strong>process of learning</strong>. If you’re interested in learning more, you know
what to do next.</p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2017/10/22/beware-the-too-fast/"/>
    <updated>2017-10-22T13:35:17+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2017/10/22/beware-the-too-fast</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the 16th of October 2017 took place the <a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture/sa-eu/public/schedule/grid/public/2017-10-16">O&#8217;Reilly Software Architecture Conference</a> in London. During the first two days, I attended to keynotes and talks where the <a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture/sa-eu/public/schedule/speakers">speakers</a> shared their learning and thoughts on software architecture, architects roles, architecture documentation, developers skills both technical and soft.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the enterprise software development space, you&rsquo;re probably aware that two types of categories of businesses exist out there, the ones that have a micro-services architecture and are practicing continuous deployment, and the others struggling to get there, dealing with their fat old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_system">monolithic</a> application. Clearly, the monolithic architecture is still heavily present in the industry and the move towards modularity is still a case by case challenge.</p>

<p>What I heard in the talks and during my discussions with the experts, surprised me and reassured me at the same time. When it comes to breaking down the monolith, all seemed to agree on a common approach, a pragmatic approach.</p>

<p>It started in the key notes, with <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/3609">Mark Richards</a> using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steeplechase">Steeplechase</a> metaphor to explain how companies should move towards micro-services.</p>

<p><a href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-10-22-beware-the-too-fast/steeplechase.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-10-22-beware-the-too-fast/steeplechase.jpg"></a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In summary, what Mark says, companies moving from monolithic application to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">micro-services</a> architecture are like a person that never rode a horse, starts directly practicing steeplechase. Obviously the person is going to fall, and the fall will be hard.
The common sense would be to first learn how to ride a horse, and then to learn how to ride fast, and then and only then you try steeplechase.</p>

<p>Applying this approach to the monolithic application means that the first step is to move to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">service oriented architecture</a> (SOA), this doesn&rsquo;t require <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a>, it doesn&rsquo;t require organizational change either, and no deployment model change.
After this first step, the move to micro-services can be initiated. Mark Richards recipe is not to move the whole application but rather start by the portion that are customer facing and where a micro-service model will bring added value to the customer.</p>

<p>A bit later, while discussing with <a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture/sa-eu/public/schedule/speaker/278928">James Thompson</a> on learning culture in software development organizations, I asked him if he faces situation where the developers eagerness to learn new stuff could put technological choices at risk. He smiles and deliberately tells me &ldquo;<em>I always choose boring technologies</em>&rdquo;. He recommends to stick proven technology as long as it does the job ; &ldquo;<em>if postgersql can do the job, don&rsquo;t use mongodb just because it&rsquo;s webscale</em>&rdquo;. For him, the real challenge is knowing  when to invest in new technology that represent real value to the organization. His recipe to tackling this, is to work on moving the team from a developer mindset to an engineering mindset. A mindset that cares about the product being built and that cares to have a rigorous process from writing code to deployment and customer experience. For James, what could hinder companies in such approach, is the long client feedback loop, the longer it is the harder is to make the shift. Inhis opinion, only organizational changes can help overcoming the feedback loop issue.</p>

<p><a href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-10-22-beware-the-too-fast/learning.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-10-22-beware-the-too-fast/learning.jpg"></a></p>

<p>On another &ldquo;meet the experts&rdquo; session, I had the chance to assist to a round table with <a href="http://samnewman.io/">Sam Newman</a>. As author of the book <a href="http://samnewman.io/books/building_microservices/">Building Microservices</a>, it was only normal to ask him how one can move form monolithic application to a micro-services architectures. And again I was happy to hear a pragmatic answer advising people to seek for modularity first before jumping to micro-services. His point of view is that modularisation still bring a lot of value, start from what the language can bring you ; if you&rsquo;re in java use java modules or jars ; having a clean modular architecture is the first step. And then and only consider moving to a microservice what would bring more value to the product and the customer, &ldquo;&hellip; the goal is not to move the application to a micro-services architecture, but rather to make it bring  in the money to the company&hellip;&rdquo; he said laughing out loud !  Again his point was about taking the time to learn and get familiar with micro-services before moving towards, and after that only to move once the value of the shift is identified.</p>

<p>Finally, in his talk about <a href="Cloud%20Native%20Designs">Cloud Native Designs</a>, <a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture/sa-eu/public/schedule/speaker/122725">Michael Hausenblas</a> states the same idea when it comes to moving to DevOps. He describes a  Cloud Native Dev and Ops Maturity Model, with four different levels and again stresses on the necessity to go through the maturity levels one level at the time. It&rsquo;s a learning path, and by jumping too fast too early the risk of failing is high.
To sum it all up, one of my major takeaway from these talks and discussions is the <strong>baby steps approach</strong>, the importance of <strong>taking the time to learn</strong> before jumping into new things, and moreover the importance to <strong>be guided by the value</strong> the change will bring to the organization.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Agile Managers, A Blind Spot?]]></title>
    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2017/07/27/agile-managers/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-27T20:20:14+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2017/07/27/agile-managers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When deploying lean and agility a lot of recommendation exist on how to take care of your collaborators during this change process. <br/>
In the literature, agile experts insist a lot on the necessity to pay attention in giving the right level of empowerment to teams and individuals. Teams are encouraged to self-organize, to take things in hand and work actively on improving their deliverable and their process.<br/>
Moreover, management is asked to provide a safe environment that foster experimentation and give the team the right to learn from its failures.<br/>
The manager role is banished in all agile frameworks, and rather replaced by team supporting roles, such as Scrum Master and Product Owner in the SCRUM framework. These new roles are rather focused on helping the team reach its goals in a servant-leader manner. <br/>
All this looks great, self-organization, empowerment, decentralized decision making &hellip; teamwork sounds great in an agile world, but unfortunately there&rsquo;s a caveat.</p>

<p><a href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-07-27-agile-managers/and-pretty-agile.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-07-27-agile-managers/and-pretty-agile.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Often lean and agile frameworks are deployed and applied to the corporate process delivering values while the organization remain the same. For the company board, managers are still part of the organizational chart and are still accountable on achieving the business goals. The same managers to which agile experts are saying to let go, give the teams autonomy and a safe environment. But what about these managers, who is giving them the safe environment to let go? How a manager can feel safe while he&rsquo;s accountable on the performance of his teams while feeling not in control anymore?  Well the obvious answer is, in the same way he should provide a safe environment for his collaborators, his superiors should equally provide him with one to operate within, self-organize and learn. <br/>
From this, it&rsquo;s clear that, when it comes to deploying agility, the whole chain of command should apply the same principles.  Traditional command and control management is incompatible with the mission command style of agile teams, thus breaking the agile chain will only lead to failure. <br/>
Deploying agility in enterprise can&rsquo;t be done only for business processes it should be holistic and include the organizational processes too. Even more in case of phased deployment, enterprise should rather start by deploying agility to the organizational processes to shift the mindsets and interactions, doing this will facilitate the deployment of agility for business processes and increase the chances of success. <br/>
Unfortunately, most of the enterprises, if not all, start deploying agility to business processes. The choice is usually driven by the gains perceived in improving the business processes, while ignoring the strong dependency on the organizational processes. The irony is that the agile product management practices should have helped to get the correct sequencing, and the enterprise most probably used transnational management practices to plan and deploy agility! Food for thought &hellip;</p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2017/05/07/turn-the-software-development-team-around-with-scrum/"/>
    <updated>2017-05-07T13:56:53+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2017/05/07/turn-the-software-development-team-around-with-scrum</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Turn-Ship-Around-Building-Breaking/dp/0241250943">Turn The Ship Around!</a>, <a href="http://www.davidmarquet.com/">L. David Marquet</a> tells us how he transformed the culture of a united states submarine from a leader-follower culture to a leader-leader culture.<br/>
Moreover, he proves the benefits of this cultural change that made the submarine crew improve from the least to the most effective one.<br/>
While reading this book, thing that I enjoyed and recommend, I couldn&rsquo;t help but projecting the ideas explained in the book against my experience with agile software development teams and more specifically the SCRUM framework usage. The book made me see the different practices and principles used in <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum/core-scrum-values-roles">SCRUM</a> under a new and interesting perspective.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll try to share this with you in this blog-post.</p>

<p><a href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-05-07-turn-the-software-development-team-around-with-scrum/submarine.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-05-07-turn-the-software-development-team-around-with-scrum/submarine.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The first concept that caught my attention in the book is around <strong>control</strong>. The author speaks about the importance of delegating control and decision making authority, and provides some of mechanisms to implement this. I chose to zoom on the following ones: <strong>Short, Early Conversations Make Efficient Work</strong>, <strong>Use &ldquo;Intend to &hellip;&rdquo; to Turn Passive Followers into Active Leaders</strong>, <strong>Eliminate Top-Down Monitoring Systems</strong>, <strong>Think Out Loud</strong>.<br/>
You must be wondering by now, what does that have to do with agility and software development. Well in agile software development, autonomy is one of the main characteristics for team effectiveness, delegating control and decision making is contributing to the autonomy of the teams and individuals. It&rsquo;s clear that we are on the same page here.<br/>
Adopting short and early conversations to improve efficiency is just another way to describe the following agile principle: &ldquo;The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation&rdquo;. The similarities don&rsquo;t stop here, when applying SCRUM, the Daily stand-up ritual makes the team adopt the &ldquo;I intend to &hellip;&rdquo; mechanism. Moreover, SCRUM offers many opportunities for team members to adopt a &ldquo;think out loud&rdquo; mechanism, whether in backlog grooming sessions, poker estimations, sprint reviews, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.<br/>
SCRUM teams commit on their deliveries in sprint plannings and naturally monitor and report their progress to their stakeholders in sprint reviews, thus eliminating the top down monitoring activity. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to see SCRUM teams producing indicators on their progress, the quality of their work, and making use of visual monitoring in order to share the information.</p>

<p><a href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-05-07-turn-the-software-development-team-around-with-scrum/la-conversation.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-05-07-turn-the-software-development-team-around-with-scrum/la-conversation.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The second concept in the book is about <strong>competence</strong>, continuously improving it and acquiring new ones.<br/>
SCRUM enables this continuous learning approach for teams. For instance the retrospective is the dedicated ceremony in SCRUM to inspect how the team is doing and define improvement actions.  It&rsquo;s also common for effective SCRUM team to leave some &ldquo;slack&rdquo; in their backlog to work on some innovations and learning tasks. Moreover, it&rsquo;s usual  for software development teams adopting SCRUM to also adopt the extreme programming principles, the latter introduces several practices aiming to improve the teams competence like pair programming and code review. <br/>
Going back to the agile software development teams characteristics it&rsquo;s clear that with the competence concern we&rsquo;re hitting the mastery characteristic the team should have to become effective.</p>

<p><a href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-05-07-turn-the-software-development-team-around-with-scrum/skills.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-05-07-turn-the-software-development-team-around-with-scrum/skills.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Last the author speaks about the <strong>clarity</strong> and it&rsquo;s importance when applying the previous principles.<br/>
In SCRUM clarity of the goals is achieved through the customer collaboration, the recurrent sprint review and sprint planning sessions. The introduction the product owner role within the team helps in clarifying the goals anytime it&rsquo;s needed. So last but not least we get to the third main characteristic necessary for an agile software development team; the purpose.</p>

<p><a href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-05-07-turn-the-software-development-team-around-with-scrum/clarity.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-05-07-turn-the-software-development-team-around-with-scrum/clarity.jpg"></a></p>

<p>In summary, in Turn The Ship Around!, L. David Marquet tells a story of deploying autonomy, mastery and purpose to a submarine crew and making it improve from a below average score to the highest score. The SCRUM agile framework, when applied correctly, can help you do the same for software development teams.</p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2017/02/25/managing-agile-autonomous-teams-a-paradox/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-25T18:31:50+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Agile teams are known to be autonomous and self-organizing.  <br/>
When I started fostering agility and encouraging autonomy and self-organization for the teams I work with, It was only normal to to face a situation where teams decided to do things their way, under the name of autonomy and self-organization. <br/>
The problem was that the direction they were heading in was not going to lead to the collective success of the enterprise.<br/>
My role was to help them succeed, thus I had the challenge of directing them while helping them improve their agility and thus their autonomy and self organization.<br/>
Is that an impossible equation to solve ?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>If you&rsquo;re new to agility you might think that this a proof that agility fails in an enterprise context and is only meant for a small team.<br/>
Fortunately it&rsquo;s not the case, agility, when well understood and applied, works at scale and delivers its promises.<br/>
Autonomy of agile teams is a must but it&rsquo;s not sufficient, along that, teams in an enterprise context need alignment.
Autonomy without alignment will only lead to anarchy, and this is something you don&rsquo;t want. Anarchy rarely leads to success.  <br/>
Only when both alignment and autonomy are present, agile teams can become successful.</p>

<p>This is greatly illustrated by <a href="http://blog.crisp.se/author/henrikkniberg">Henrik Kniberg</a> in the “<a href="http://blog.crisp.se/2014/03/27/henrikkniberg/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1">Spotify Engineering Culture</a>” and several of this talks.</p>

<p><a href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-02-25-managing-agile-autonomous-teams-a-paradox/autonomy-alignment-kniberg.png"><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-02-25-managing-agile-autonomous-teams-a-paradox/autonomy-alignment-kniberg.png"></a></p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Down here is low alignment and low autonomy. Micromanagement Culture, no high level purpose just shut up and follow orders.</li>
<li>Up here is high Alignment, but low autonomy. So leaders are good communicating what problems needs to be solved, but also they are telling people how to solve it.</li>
<li>High Alignment and High Autonomy means leaders focus on what problems to solve but let the teams figure out how to solve it</li>
<li>What about down here then? Low alignment and high autonomy. Means teams do whatever they want…</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>But how do teams get alignment ?</p>

<p>As alignment aim to make several teams work toward the same goals, it&rsquo;s by design an external factor to the teams.<br/>
Thus the teams can&rsquo;t achieve alignment on their own.<br/>
Agile managers are still an important piece of the puzzle, and fit naturally in the agile context.   <br/>
By helping teams getting alignment, they provide them with one of the necessary ingredients for their success.</p>

<p><a href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-02-25-managing-agile-autonomous-teams-a-paradox/velib.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2017-02-25-managing-agile-autonomous-teams-a-paradox/velib.jpg"></a></p>

<p>I work in a fast-paced and constantly changing work environment, with geographically dispersed and culturally diverse teams, reaching alignment in such context is not an easy task. <br/>
As an agile manager I need to constantly drive alignment, in order to allow autonomy to build. It&rsquo;s about keeping the people and the work progressing in the correct direction toward to the goals, and it&rsquo;s not to be confused by staying &ldquo;on plan&rdquo;.<br/>
To accomplish this I practice consistently communicated, measurable, incremental goals.<br/>
In my next post I&rsquo;ll explain one of the tools I use to bring that guidance to the agile teams.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>T-shaped skills or persons is a metaphor for the depth and breadth that an
individual has in their skills.<br/>
It was first introduced by Tim Brown in 1991 as a method to build a workforce of
interdisciplinary individuals for creative processes.</p>

<p>The vertical bar on the ‘T’ represents the depth of related skills and expertise
in a single field, whereas the horizontal bar represents a breadth of skills and
the ability to collaborate across disciplines with experts in other areas and to
apply knowledge in areas of expertise other than one’s own.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Lately many things changed in the software industry. Not only the technology
stack but also the methodologies and processes.</p>

<p>The cloud and IoT revolution are pushing the enterprises to evolve their
technological stacks and architectures in order to stay in the race. It&rsquo;s not
enough for a developer anymore to have a specialty (be in a expert in back-end,
front-end, or a particular technology stack), he also needs to be comfortable in
doing a wide range of development work and understand how his work interacts
with the work of the rest of the developers in the organization.</p>

<p>It is not possible anymore for a developer to sit in his own little area
worrying about only his little part of the puzzle with clear definitions of
responsibility. Staying in such a model will inevitably create a world of silos,
isolated and closed knowledge, in other words, a world of &ldquo;not my problem&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Agility adoption in software houses is rising, and developers in these
organizations are expected to be comfortable in not just doing a wide range of
development work, but also to self-organize, to improve their work and
processes, to help steer the ship, and to participate in product management and
design thinking activities.</p>

<p>The industry is also adopting the DevOps movement in order to improve solutions
and meet clients expectations.<br/>
This requires developers to have clear methodologies to work with, a supportive
organizational culture, and tools that automate the simple tasks.</p>

<p>Having an interdisciplinary workforce of  software developers has become crucial
for any enterprise in such context.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-12-17-why-developers-need-t-shaped-skills/learning.jpg"></p>

<p>Becoming a T-shaped developer requires developing one or more deep skill-sets of
knowledge complemented with broad generalist knowledge across an entire
solution. Acquiring new skills requires a different mindset and a serious
investment. Adopting a continuous learning approach and continuously expanding
knowledge area, are mandatory to succeed in growing both bars of the T.
Fortunately, nowadays software developers have a wide choice of means to grow
his expertise and learn new skills: books, blogs, hacking events, conferences,
podcasts, programming challenges, meetups, etc. All these activities will help a
developer to build T-Shaped skills and succeed in the software industry.</p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2016/11/05/working-agreements/"/>
    <updated>2016-11-05T19:57:29+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this you probably have good understanding of agile teams characteristics.
So you know that agile teams are not just a group of individuals working each one alone, on their individual goals or within their area of expertise.   <br/>
And that Agile team members share common goals, work together, and support each other in achieving their commitments, in a all the team succeed or all the team fail spirit. <br/>
Finally, Agile teams are self-organized and their day to day activity involve increased communication and collaboration.</p>

<p>But you might be wondering what make agile teams reach top performance and effectiveness. Interested to know ?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-11-05-working-agreements/f4-1.png"></p>

<p>In 1965, Bruce Tuckman was the first to propose a team development model. <br/>
In his model, a team need to go through four stages in order to reach effectiveness and performance.
At the start, the team is formed, members agree on the goals and challenges, they tend to behave individually, this the first stage, called forming.<br/>
A bit later, conflicts will arise as each individual start establishing his position in the group, this is the second stage, it&rsquo;s called storming. <br/>
In the third stage, called norming, clarity for each individual role and consensus are established. The team&rsquo;s performance and effectiveness improve.<br/>
When group norms and roles are established, group members are autonomous and are able to handle the decision-making process without supervision, focusing on achieving common goals, the team reach top performance and effectiveness. It&rsquo;ll be then in the fourth stage, called performing. <br/>
Agile or not, this model applies to any team, and an agile team can accelerate its progress toward performing by
making use of the &ldquo;Working Agreement&rdquo; tool.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-11-05-working-agreements/tuckman.jpg"></p>

<p>So what are &ldquo;Working Agreements&rdquo; ?
<strong>Working agreement</strong> are a set of rules or protocols the team agree to follow when working together.
They help the team meet its goals, establishing a one team culture and developing a sense of shared responsibility.<br/>
They also help team members to increase the awareness of their own behavior and empower each one of them to act.</p>

<p><strong>Working agreements</strong> are owned and set by the team.
All team members have the responsibility to question anyone not following the rules.<br/>
This removes the perception of personal attacks and confrontation.<br/>
Working agreements need to be continuously improved, this can be done by the team regularly asking the question &ldquo;Should we update them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Good working agreements are focused on amplifying desired patterns of behavior.
They are aimed at helping the team members achieve their tasks and team-work goals.
They can be generalizable and are written with minimum specifications.</p>

<p>Three key elements make working agreements effective in helping the team.
The first one is their importance to the team : working agreements need to be fully supported by each team member, and members are reminded when agreements are not followed.  
The second one is their number: the set of Working agreements need to have a limited number of rules. The team has to review regularly the list to ensure it contains the rules the team needs to focus on.      
The third one is documented: by documented I mean defined and known by all team members. Ideally the should be made visible by posting them on a wall or an electronic board.    
Following these three rules will help you ensure effective working agreements fro your team.  </p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-11-05-working-agreements/f4-2.png"></p>

<p>A team can setup its first working agreement during a retrospective or a dedicated session.<br/>
The session can be facilitated by the product owner, the scrum master or any other team member.  <br/>
The facilitator start by explaining the why and what of working agreements. <br/>
He then give some examples like: be on time, respect estimates, how to address bugs/fires during Sprint, etc.<br/>
He then ask the team to suggest points that are crucial for their improvement and the reasons why they think those should be work agreements. <br/>
The team then take a vote to pick the top five/seven ideas as a work agreements.
The work doesn&rsquo;t stop here, as I said before, the list should be reviewed regularly, retrospective meeting is an option.<br/>
Once team members feel they are doing well on one agreement, they can replace it with another agreement to focus on. It&rsquo;s a good idea to keep the removed items in a sort of culture book for newcomers, after all the item was removed because it became a habit for the team members and anyone joining the team need to learn about it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Continuous improvement is one of the necessary pillars when it comes to Agile.<br/>
Failing to improve your process won&rsquo;t let you unlock its full potential nor reach the benefits promised by Agile.  <br/>
But whether you&rsquo;re practicing agile or not, I&rsquo;m bet that you do care about improving what your doing.  <br/>
Identifying things to improve can be done by conducting a retrospective session.<br/>
Retrospective is a special meeting that takes place at the end of an iteration or a project.<br/>
It is a dedicated moment where the team take time to inspect the work done and try to spot opportunities for improvement.<br/>
Planning and conducting retrospectives is not hard, but some pitfalls might prevent you from getting out the desired outcome. Read on to know what are the 6 things that could ruin your retrospectives.</p>

<h1>Totally winging it</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-07-28-6-things-that-can-ruin-your-retrospective/totally-winging-it.jpg">
As any other work session or meeting a retrospective should be structured and activities prepared.<br/>
A retrospective is usually composed from several activities that will help the team spot imrovement opportunities and deduce relevant actions.  <br/>
To achieve this goal the activities need to fit well together, the timing already figured out and sometime materials need to be prepared up-front, like posters, cards, etc.<br/>
Improvising your session will most probably lead to poor outcomes. <br/>
My advise: take the time, 15 to 20 minutes are enough to structure a retrospective.<br/>
Choose a theme and the sequence of the activities, take some time to refresh your memory on how they are conducted, specify the time you&rsquo;re going to allocate to each one. Share the agenda with the team at the start.</p>

<h1>Fighting Hunger</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-07-28-6-things-that-can-ruin-your-retrospective/fighting-hunger.jpg">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#Physiological_needs">Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs</a> tells us that food is one of the very basic human needs. <br/>
You need to remeber that whenever you find yourself in the obligation to plan a retrospective during lunchtime.<br/>
It&rsquo;s better to avoid such situation, participants will be only thinking on when the session will end so that they can get to eat. At worst if you can&rsquo;t avoid it, do order food for the team, competing against hunger is a lost battle. <br/>
As a general rule, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have some fruits or candies available for participants. This will help them to remain energized and contributes to the good working atmosphere. <br/>
Don&rsquo;t forget to schedule a short break in the middle of the session, let people get out of the room, fulfill their needs, grab a cup of cofee or a bottle of water.</p>

<h1>Lightning Speed Retrospective</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-07-28-6-things-that-can-ruin-your-retrospective/lightning-speed-retrospective.jpg">
A typical retrospective will take between 1h30min and 2h to deliver good actionable items. It&rsquo;s simply the time needed to collect the data, analyze it and deduce improvement actions.<br/>
If the team is lacking time, the last thing to is to shorten the retrospective. Doing that will only lead to the opposite desired outcome, wasting time on an inefficient session. <br/>
When the team find itself unable to allocate the appropriate time to its retrospective, my advice is to exceptionally skip the occurrence, secure the next retrospective and make sure the team identify what need to be done to avoid hitting the same issue in the future.</p>

<h1>Skipping the Starter</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-07-28-6-things-that-can-ruin-your-retrospective/skipping-the-starter.jpg">
It&rsquo;s a good practice to start any work session with an ice breaker. Why ? Studies have shown that when a  participant in a meeting doesn&rsquo;t speak during the first five minutes, he usually remain silent till the end of the session. <br/>
You don&rsquo;t want that to happen to your retrospective, on the contrary you want all the participants to speak up and share their concerns and ideas on improvement. <br/>
By skipping your check-in activity you are giving each participant the permission to remain silent for the rest of the session.
Spending 5 or 10 minutes in an ice break at the start of the retrospective is good investment to make that can only improve the outcomes.</p>

<h1>Skipping the Desert</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-07-28-6-things-that-can-ruin-your-retrospective/skipping-the-desert.jpg">
Retrospecting is part of your process, so as the rest it can and need to be improved constantly.<br/>
The check-out activity is your opportunity to get feedback from the participants in order to improve the next occurrences.<br/>
Don&rsquo;t skip it, make sure you plan a &ldquo;Return on Time Invested&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Plus/Delta&rdquo; activity to get insights on what can be improved.</p>

<h1>All Talk and No Action</h1>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-07-28-6-things-that-can-ruin-your-retrospective/all-talk-and-no-action.jpg">
Your team is extremely busy and improvement actions are piling up in a todo list somewhere.<br/>
Clearly the teams not improving, and it will soon start loosing faith in retrospectives and see them rather as waste.<br/>
This pitfall can be avoided by simply adding the identified improvement actions to the team backlog and treat them as any other task in the backlog.  Apply to them the same prioritizing technique and plan them accordingly. <br/>
In the Scrum framework this technique is called &ldquo;Scrumming the Scrum&rdquo;.</p>

    <updated>2016-06-18T08:03:51+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2016/06/18/a-simple-way-to-run-a-solution-focused-retrospective</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While attending to a <a href="https://management30.com/events/two-day-course/">2-day course on Management 3.0</a>, on of the new things I discovered was the &ldquo;solution focus&rdquo; approach to improving things. Googling on the matter I learned that this technique come from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_focused_brief_therapy">&ldquo;Solution focused brief therapy&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-06-18-a-simple-way-to-run-a-solution-focused-retrospective/problem-solution.jpg"></p>

<p>In a solution focused brief therapy (SFBT) the patient is asked to focus on solution-building rather than problem-solving. This can be achieved by exploring current resources and future hopes rather than present problems and past causes. <br/>
First thing that popped to my mind when discovering SFBT, is its similarity to an agile retrospective.<br/>
Retrospective main aim is to spot improvement opportunities and come up with actions to make things better in the future.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been conducting and participating to retrospectives for several years now, but unlike SFBT, we were often digging to identify the root-cause of problems and then trying to figure out solutions.<br/>
SFBT opened a new perspective for me. Finding the root-cause in a retrospective is putting the effort in looking into the past. Applying SFBT to a retrospective implied not putting the effort on analyzing what happened but rather putting it in finding an action that can lead to a better future.</p>

<p>How can you do that? Here&rsquo;s the simple recipe I used.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>When conducting retrospective I like to follow the structure proposed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8w-dFrmovQ">&ldquo;Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great&rdquo;</a> by Esther Derby and Diana Larsen. I always structure my retrospective accordingly.</p>

<p>I start by a <strong><em>set the stage</em></strong> activity to break the ice, and a <strong><em>closing</em></strong> activity to share appreciations or get feedback. You can compare these to a starter and a desert in 3-courses menu.<br/>
The main course is where most of the work happen, and it goes like this.<br/>
It starts with an activity to <strong><em>gather data</em></strong> regarding the last iteration from the participants followed by an activity enabling <strong><em>insights generation</em></strong> leading the team to <strong><em>deciding what to do</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>generate insight</em></strong> activity is usually where the team look at the problem, brainstorm to identify the root. Classical activities that can be used are 5-whys analysis, fishbone, etc. It&rsquo;s then followed by an activity to identify the actions and <strong><em>decide what to do</em></strong> like SMART goals, Short subjects, etc.</p>

<p>In a <strong>solution focused</strong> retrospective both activities can be replaced by a single solution oriented activity conducted as follow:</p>

<p>Assuming that the team did a <strong><em>gather data</em></strong> activity and identified themes to work on, divide the participants in groups of 3 or 4, each group takes a theme to work on. In some cases it might possible for the group to work on all the themes.</p>

<p>Ask the group to consider the following two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Regarding the chosen theme, on a scale from 1 to 10 where do you think we are today?</strong></li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-06-18-a-simple-way-to-run-a-solution-focused-retrospective/rating-scale.png"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What action cans be done in the next iteration accomplish a +1 improvement?</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Then ask the group to work 4 small iterations, each one of 6 minutes as follows:</p>

<p>Iteration 1 - <strong>On your own, self brain dumping / Silence / Post&#8217;it.</strong></p>

<p>Iteration 2 - <strong>Together, Share.</strong></p>

<p>Iteration 3 - <strong>Aggregate &amp; Consolidate.</strong></p>

<p>Iteration 4 - <strong>Finalize &amp; prepare a 1&#8217;30 pitch to share with the other groups.</strong></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-06-18-a-simple-way-to-run-a-solution-focused-retrospective/post-it.jpg"></p>

<p>I usually remind the groups to make us of the SMART goals approach when deciding on the actions for the next iteration.</p>

<p>This recipe worked well for me, I found a good way to make the team discover new ways of identifying improvements actions. It&rsquo;s also a good way to bring novelty to the retrospective and avoid falling into monotony.  I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;ll be making use form time to time of it in my future working sessions. If you like this activity or would like to propose changes, please do not hesitate to leave your highly welcome comment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/collective.html">Collective Ownership</a> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">Extreme Programming</a> rule that encourages everyone to contribute to all parts of the code.<br/>
Any developer can change any line of code to add functionality, fix bugs, improve designs or refactor.<br/>
Collective Ownership mentality is great because every developer feels like he own the code.<br/>
This drives quality up and fuels the passion that leads to inspiration.<br/>
I&rsquo;m a strong believer in the benefits of this approach and always encouraging my development teams to adopt it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">Bus factor</a> is the answer to a simple question: &ldquo;how many people would need to get hit by a bus before this code collapses due to lack of knowledgeable or competent personnel?&rdquo; <br/>
You want that number to be high.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#@author">@author</a> tag is a signpost telling everyone else to stay away:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the owner, this file belongs to me, no one else should touch it or at best you need to ask for my permission before modifying the code&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-03-03-why-i-dont-like-the-at-author-tags/do-not-touch.jpg"></p>

<p>It creates an single developer ownership mentality of portions of the code driving the bus factor toward one, and thus putting the project at risk.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#@author">@author</a> tag, I hope I convinced you to stop or at least made you aware of its danger.</p>

    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2016/01/26/is-it-realistic-to-manage-closely-several-agile-teams</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been recently promoted to manage a division in software development department of my company.<br/>
Till then I was used to managing one team at a once, not exceeding 10 people in size.<br/>
Now I find myself with 8 teams to manage having each a size ranging from 4 to 7 people.</p>

<p>In my previous role I was comfortable with adopting the SCRUM agile framework and quite used to play the role of the scrum master and to participate actively to the product owner role. <br/>
Some of the new teams were already trying to follow the agile practices, some were still working with rather a traditional waterfall approach.
So naturally I found myself driving the teams to adopt the SCRUM framework.
I made sure to share with them my return on experience and to point out the pitfalls and the small details that can make a difference.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-01-26-is-it-realistic-to-manage-closely-several-agile-teams/scrum.png"></p>

<p>Fortunately for me the resistance to change was less than expected. <br/>
All the teams were eager to try the new framework and to improve their agile practices.    <br/>
This is when things start to get a bit more complicated.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>Among the teams that had tried agile methods, some had tried the SCRUM framework before but ended up by letting it go. Some accommodated the framework with what they thought it would suit them better and thus were practicing a modified custom version.</p>

<p>This reminded me of the caveat entitled <a href="https://books.google.fr/books?id=pjLcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21&amp;lpg=PT21&amp;dq=%22Do+not+change+scrum%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZLjZe7HpGC&amp;sig=fZakjNenlohycnYqsULErZxMPlY&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVm-C3gMbKAhXLthoKHcC1AKgQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><strong><em>Do not change scrum</em></strong> <em>in The Enterprise and Scrum (by Ken Schwaber)</em></a></p>

<p>Having observed that, it was clear to me that I had to bring the teams to the required level of understanding of the methodology and to help them in the adoption and ramp up phase.</p>

<p>Doing that was not a problem for me, on the contrary I enjoy playing the role of the scrum master in an agile development team. The problem was rather a capacity one, will I have enough time to do it right.</p>

<p>You might say, sure it won’t take that long to train a group of people to an agile methodology. <br/>
I can’t disagree with that, after all I had my scrum master certification after a two days training.<br/>
But what I also know, is that it took me nearly two years of practice to be able to take full advantage of the framework. So when I say doing it right, I mean working closely with each team trying to share with them what I learnt and helping them reaching the tipping point to becoming agile.</p>

<p>The couple of teams I had selected to start with showed high appreciation of the help they received and I could instantly see the difference and the positive impact on their day to day job.</p>

<p>But till now I haven’t managed to keep a regular pace to assist closely all the teams in this adoption process and this doesn’t make me feel satisfied. With all the responsibilities I have to assume I never get the time needed to accompany the teams in all of their agile ceremonies.<br/>
Since a couple of days I’ve been asking myself, assuming I had nothing else to do, is it possible to do such a close follow up? That’s when I decide to do the math.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2016-01-26-is-it-realistic-to-manage-closely-several-agile-teams/calculator.jpg"></p>

<p>For one team, per iteration of two weeks, I will need to allocate:    <br/>
- 3 hours for the demo/sprint planning   <br/>
- 2 hours to retrospect<br/>
- 2 hours to participate to the backlog grooming  <br/>
- 10 x 15 minutes of daily stand up</p>

<p>This leads us to 9 hours and 30 minutes per team every two weeks, multiplying this by 8 leads us to a total of 76 hours. So at the end doing the close follow up with all teams will require me to allocate 38 hours per week for this activity alone; a full time job!</p>

<p>Although this seem to fit in my working hours habit I doubt I will go that way.<br/>
Why? Because the expectations from my new role go beyond that, I have other duties to fulfill that are part of the role and that are time consuming too, nearly half of my time.</p>

<p>So what next? Well no doubt, I’ll need to make a choice, follow the most important things and delegate the rest.<br/>
First action is to ask a team member to play the role of the scrum master for a given iteration. All team members will play this role in a round robin fashion. <br/>
Second action is to skip attending the daily standups, this will let me gain back 10 hours per week, and I believe the teams will be able to conduct them efficiently on their own with the help of the assigned scrum master.</p>

<p>Next step will be to opt out from the retrospectives once the team is used to conducting them. Of course I will provide my notes to a team member and ask him to represent me. This will let me on the long term get back 8 hours.</p>

<p>So in total I will need to allocate 20 hours per week to perform the remaining activities which seem reasonable. I believe this close follow up will yield to a better results, I’ll be trying this and learning from the experience.</p>

<p>Interested in the outcome? Stay tuned.</p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/10/19/beating-the-meeting-run/"/>
    <updated>2015-10-19T20:00:46+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/10/19/beating-the-meeting-run</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just one full week in my new job, that&rsquo;s what it took me  to experience a new kind of sport, the &ldquo;Meeting Run&rdquo;.<br/>
And as a good friend of mine would say, like everything there are always two sides. <br/>
In what I experienced I encountered a good one and a bad one (and no there&rsquo;s no <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/">ugly</a> one, at least not yet).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-10-19-beating-the-meeting-run/time.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>
The good side was that my <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness&amp;hl=fr">Google Fit application</a> started congratulating me everyday for meeting my 1 hour walking goal, and sometimes I would even hit that by noon!</p>

<p>In 15 years in software development, it never happened to me during work days ! (yes I know you might argue that smartphones and activity tracking applications are rather recent, so you&rsquo;ll have to take my word for that).   <br/>
This is great news, I finally managed to exercise and work at the same time, there&rsquo;s a hope for me to loose the kilos I gained this summer!</p>

<p>And as you might suspect there&rsquo;s no free lunch so where&rsquo;s the catch? <br/>
Well here&rsquo;s the bad side ; since all meetings were adjacent, it was just impossible for me to arrive at time to any meeting.<br/>
And it really annoyed me, I always used to do my best to be at most on time if not a couple of minutes before. <br/>
But I admit when I was able to do this my calendar looked a little bit different than it is now.<br/>
The same pattern occurred the whole week, and I started getting calls from people waiting for me in the next meeting.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, this is the end, I said to myself sadly ; bye bye punctuality and welcome reality &hellip;<br/>
Fortunately a little voice in my head was whispering &ldquo;no, no, no&rdquo; and when I paid attention I heard it say &ldquo;&hellip; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken window theory</a> &hellip; <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professionalism/Diane_Vaughan_and_the_normalization_of_deviance">normalization of deviance</a> &hellip;&rdquo;. <br/>
And it just hit me, it was clear to me that I was slipping into these anti-patterns.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-10-19-beating-the-meeting-run/broken-window.png"></p>

<p>Accepting being late to meeting is a clear illustration of &ldquo;Diane Vaughan&rsquo;s normalization of deviance&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Social normalization of deviance means that people within the organization become so much accustomed to a deviant behavior that they don&rsquo;t consider it as deviant, <br/>
despite the fact that they far exceed their own rules for the elementary safety&rdquo;. People grow more accustom to the deviant behavior the more it occurs. To people outside of the organization, <br/>
the activities seem deviant; however, people within the organization do not recognize the deviance because it is seem as a normal occurrence. <br/>
In hindsight, people within the organization realize that their seemingly normal behavior was deviant.</p></blockquote>

<p>And worse, it&rsquo;s the first broken window I&rsquo;m inviting to my work habits. What next, I&rsquo;ll start accepting code with less quality, shipping untested code to production, and end up considering compiler warnings as just normal messages! <br/>
NO, NO, NO, this is not an option. <br/>
But how to avoid that?  How to avoid adjacent meetings? One might be tempted by defining a process to manage his calendar.  <br/>
And start thinking about rules, like meetings should not be adjacent, or they should never be scheduled to start at hh:00 but rather hh:05.<br/>
But how to enforce that, you might think about developing an outlook extension for that &hellip; <br/>
That was really compelling for the software engineer in me, but for the pragmatic developer it looked complex and too much, it also required everybody to be aligned with the rules when booking meetings.  <br/>
I needed something that I can achieve on my own, where I have full control to apply it, something that would be simple.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-10-19-beating-the-meeting-run/punctuality.png"></p>

<p>Suddenly it all became clear. The solution is simple, do like the <a href="https://www.bitcoinmining.com/">Bitcoin miner</a>. A Bitcoin miner will keep a small fee for himself when validating a transaction.<br/>
All I have to do is the same, I&rsquo;ll just apply a tax to the meeting time and take 5 minutes for me.<br/>
This will let me leave the meeting 5 minutes early, of course I&rsquo;ll inform people at the start that I&rsquo;ll be leaving early.<br/>
And that&rsquo;s it ! A simple and actionable solution.  <br/>
Abiding by this rule I will hopefully get back punctuality and avoid annoying people by arriving late to meetings.</p>

<p><strong>So from now on, if you&rsquo;re in a meeting with me, be advised, there&rsquo;s a fee, I&rsquo;ll be leaving 5 minutes early!  </strong></p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/09/20/agile-retrospectives-using-trello/"/>
    <updated>2015-09-20T20:31:53+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/09/20/agile-retrospectives-using-trello</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a distributed agile team working from Paris and Beirut, remote retrospectives are part of our rituals.<br/>
To conduct these remote retrospectives, we have settled on using <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>. <br/>
My colleague <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/">BOURGAU Philippe</a> has <a href="http://philippe.bourgau.net/trellospectives-remote-retrospectives-with-trello/">blogged on what we tried</a> and how we ended up by opting for Trello.<br/>
Since then we have made some improvements on speeding up the meeting preparation, and I think it&rsquo;s time to share them.
<img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-09-20-agile-retrospectives-using-trello/trello.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As you might know, retrospectives activities are recurrent, it&rsquo;s not unlikely to redo the same activity a couple of retrospectives later.<br/>
So it was natural for us to start creating boards to be used as templates for the activities. <br/>
These boards served as a starting point when setting up a session and were improved continuously. <br/>
So how is this used practically ?<br/>
<img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-09-20-agile-retrospectives-using-trello/gald-sad-mad.png">
In our case, a facilitator is responsible of preparing and animating each session. <br/>
When preparing the session, instead of creating each activity board from scratch, the facilitator had now a catalog in which he could choose the activities. <br/>
All he had to do is to copy the board, give him a specific name and share it with the team. <br/>
Each board contains a short description of the activity, and a suitable setup to conduct it.<br/>
In reality the facilitator still created boards from scratch, but only when no template was available.<br/>
But now, instead of doing it only for his session, he took the time to first create a template and then copy it into his session. <br/>
This way he would have contributed to the enrichment of the catalog and facilitated the preparation of upcoming sessions. <br/>
We&rsquo;ve been doing this for quite some time and I think it&rsquo;s worth to share it with the agile community. <br/>
We&rsquo;ve learned a lot form others&#8217; experiments and it&rsquo;s time for us to contribute back with what we experimented.  <br/>
I&rsquo;ve started publishing some of the templates I made to the <a href="https://trello.com/agileretrospectives">Agile Retrospectives</a> space, it&rsquo;s a public Trello team.
As I&rsquo;m writing this post, there are six published templates. I&rsquo;ll soon be asking other contributors on the team to share their work too, so stay tuned for more templates. <br/>
I hope you will find this useful for your retrospectives, and if you do use a template and have any improvement to make, don&rsquo;t hesitate to join the <a href="https://trello.com/agileretrospectives">team</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/09/11/making-your-xoom-2-kid-safe/"/>
    <updated>2015-09-11T21:08:35+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/09/11/making-your-xoom-2-kid-safe</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of years ago I bought the Motorola Xoom 2 for my personal usage.<br/>
It was my first Android tablet and I mainly planned to use it to make Skype calls, browse the Internet and read some e-books.
We also used it to play nursery rhyme videos to our last-born.   <br/>
As he grew, he was convinced that it was &ldquo;his&rdquo; tablet and started to play games on it.<br/>
It didn&rsquo;t take him long to figure out how to look for YouTube videos or to install new games, this is when troubles started.
     <img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-09-11-making-your-xoom-2-kid-safe/Xoom2.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It was clear for us that, unless we wanted to constantly supervise him while using the tablet, we needed a strict parental control.<br/>
The parental control is not built-in in the Xoom 2, but a lot of options are available in Google Play.<br/>
Options varies from locking apps, to safe browsers, and screen time management apps.</p>

<p>After trying some different strategies this is what I found most suitable.</p>

<p>I first rooted the tablet in order to install an ad blocker. I chose to do this because most of the free games have pop-up ads.<br/>
Beside being annoying, they are difficult for kids to skip. Most of the time the lead my kid to some content that I do not approve.</p>

<p>Then I installed <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiddoware.kidsplace">Kids Place - Parental Control</a> from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=kiddoware">kiddoware</a>.  <br/>
Beside restricting the kids to apps you have approved, Kids Place can be configured to override the &lsquo;home&rsquo; button and to run on tablet boot.<br/>
Additional plugins such as a safe video player, safe browser and screen time management can be installed too.
    <img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-09-11-making-your-xoom-2-kid-safe/Xoom2-Kids-Place.png">
With this configuration the Xoom 2 became a child safe Android tablet that I was confident to leave in my kid&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in rooting your Xoom 2, here&rsquo;s the steps to follow:<br/>
1. On tablet go to Settings -> Developers Options and enable the Usb Debugging option.      <br/>
2. On tablet go to Settings -> Security and enable Unknown Sources option. <br/>
2. Plug your tablet to your PC, check the device manager to make sure the driver is properly installed.<br/>
If you see a yellow exclamation mark next to the Xoom 2 driver, right-click on it, go to &lsquo;Driver&rsquo; tab, click &lsquo;Update Driver&rsquo;, click &lsquo;Browse my computer &hellip;&rsquo;, click the &lsquo;Let me pick &hellip;&rsquo;<br/>
From the list choose the &lsquo;Android ADB Composite Driver&rsquo;<br/>
    <img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-09-11-making-your-xoom-2-kid-safe/adb-driver.png">  <br/>
3. Download and unzip <a href="https://github.com/bil-t/android-utils/blob/master/Xoom2-IceCreamSandwich-RootFiles.zip?raw=true">Xoom2-IceCreamSandwich-RootFiles</a><br/>
4. Run DroidRazrRoot404.bat<br/>
5. Your tablet will reboot and you will have gained root access.</p>

<p>To block ads do the following:<br/>
1. download and install <a href="https://github.com/bil-t/android-utils/blob/master/AdAway-release_Build-Oct.13.2014.apk?raw=true">AdAway</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/bil-t/android-utils/blob/master/adblockplusandroid-1.3.apk?raw=true">AdBlockPlus</a><br/>
2. Grant both apps root privileges when it&rsquo;s asked for.</p>

<p>Now you&rsquo;re ready to install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiddoware.kidsplace">Kids Place - Parental Control</a> and make your tablet safer for kids.</p>

    <updated>2015-07-23T21:33:43+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/07/23/unlock-full-android-power-to-your-amazon-fire-hd-6</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently acquired an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KC6I06S/ref=ods_fs_far">Amazon Fire HD 6</a> tablet.<br/>
I had high hopes that it would be the perfect tablet to read books, use <a href="www.skype.com">Skype</a> and check mails.<br/>
I found its price attractive with respect to its characteristics, and being an old customer of Amazon I was confident that the tablet will meet my expectations.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-07-23-unlock-full-android-power-to-your-amazon-fire-hd-6/fire-gapps.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It was no surprise to me to find out that the Fire HD 6 had only access to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Store/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=133140011">Kindle Store</a>. My unpleasant surprise was discovering that <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5700313618786177705&amp;hl=fr">Google applications</a> are not available in the Amazon store.</p>

<p>Using the Fire HD 6 without the Gmail, Hangout, Drive and other google applications was not an option for me.<br/>
Knowing that the Fire HD 6 is running Android, I started looking for a way to install the Google Apps.</p>

<p>There are a lot of information on how to root the Fire HD 6 and install Google applications, unfortunately all resources are not up to date or detailed enough. It took me some time to figure it out, and after two attempts, I managed to get everything working perfectly. Here are the detailed steps that helped me get there.</p>

<p>To install Google application you need root access to the tablet.<br/>
In order to get root access the Fire HD 6 must be running the Fire OS 4.5.3 or below.  <br/>
If you, being an enthusiast like me, have upgraded you tablet OS as soon as you received it you will have to apply the following steps to downgrade back to Fire OS 4.5.3. If you&rsquo;re already running 4.5.3 skip to step 4.</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the Fire OS 5.0 developer preview

<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/platforms/android-fireos?sc_channel=EM&amp;sc_campaign=FireOSPreview&amp;sc_%20detail=GetPreview">Fire OS Developer Preview</a></li>
<li>Press the yellow <code>developer preview</code> button on the right side of the page</li>
<li>Log into your amazon account</li>
<li>Choose your device</li>
<li>Go to system settings/device options/system updates and press the check for updates button</li>
<li>Follow the instruction and complete the update</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/community/post/Tx3RZFBU0KJTSWS/Setting-up-the-ADB-Driver-for-Kindle-Fire-Devices">Set up ADB on your computer and enable ADB on your tablet</a>

<ul>
<li>Installtion of the ADB driver on my windows 8.1 didn&rsquo;t work well. The trick that worked for me was to delete the Fire device from the device manger and to manually add an android ADB composite driver.

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/07/13/turn-your-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-13T19:13:30+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/07/13/turn-your-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago, while participating to an off-site workshop, a colleague wanted to show a new mobile application prototype.</p>

<p>For this purpose he needed a phone to reach both the internet and a laptop hooked to the local network. <br/>
Since wireless connection was not available the demo was at risk.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The laptop was running windows, equipped with a wireless network card and connected via ethernet to a LAN that gave it internet access.<br/>
With that in mind, it occurred to me that making the wireless card act as an access point could be the answer.<br/>
Searching the web I was able to find out how to achieve this by using the Microsoft Virtual WiFi mini port adapter, available on both windows 7 and 8.</p>

<p>I recently re-used the same technique to watch movies served from my laptop using a raspberry pie with a usb wireless Lan adapter.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to setup the Microsoft Virtual WiFi mini port adapter in simple steps.</p>

<p>First you need to run a command line with administrator privileges:</p>

<ol>
<li>Locate the &ldquo;Command prompt&rdquo; program (Click Start, click All Programs, and then click Accessories under windows 7 or in the Start Search box, type cmd under windows 8)</li>
<li>Right-click &ldquo;Command prompt&rdquo;, and then click Run as administrator.</li>
</ol>


<p>Then you need to setup a virtual wifi by running the following command:</p>

<p><code>netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=your_wifi_name key=your_wifi_password keyUsage=persistent</code></p>

<p>Replace your_wifi_name by the name of your network and &lsquo;your_wifi_password&rsquo; by the password you want users to connect with.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-07-13-turn-your-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/cmd-1.png"></p>

<p>Then type the following command to start the hosted network:</p>

<p><code>netsh wlan start hostednetwork</code></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-07-13-turn-your-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/cmd-2.png"></p>

<p>Now all is left to do is to enable the internet sharing for this you need to got to &lsquo;Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Network and Sharing Center&rsquo; right click the newly created virtual wifi adapter, choose properties, click on the sharing tab, click the first check box and choose the appropriate networking connection:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-07-13-turn-your-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/settings-1.png"><br/>
<img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-07-13-turn-your-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/settings-2.png"></p>

<p>To check the status of your hosted network use the command:</p>

<p><code>netsh wlan show hostednetwork</code></p>

<p>It will tell you information like the used channel as well as the number of connected clients.</p>

<p>Finally to stop the hosted network use the command:</p>

<p><code>netsh wlan stop hostednetwork</code></p>

    <updated>2015-06-21T15:15:41+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/06/21/custom-scrolling-with-meteor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve recently tried using <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> to build a web application.<br/>
I used <a href="https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router">Iron.Router</a> to configure the different routes of the web application. Everything worked fine out of the box until I started using links with fragment identifiers.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First thing I wanted to add was an animated scroll behavior when navigating between anchors on the same page.<br/>
I was able to achieve this by overriding the <code>scrollToHash-function</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span> (animated-scroll.js)</span> <a href='http://bilal.eltayara.net/downloads/code/2015-06-21-custom-scrolling-with-meteor/animated-scroll.js'>download</a></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">Router</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">_scrollToHash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">hash</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">section</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">hash</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">section</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">sectionTop</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">section</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">offset</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nx">top</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;html, body&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">animate</span><span class="p">({</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="nx">scrollTop</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">sectionTop</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="p">},</span> <span class="s2">&quot;slow&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>Next I noticed that when scrolling in a page and then navigating to a new one, the scroll remained at its last position.<br/>
The user experience was not acceptable.  When navigating to a new page, the user expects to land on top of the page and not somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>To fix this behavior I used the Iron.Router <a href="https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router/blob/devel/Guide.md#hooks">hooks</a>.
I added a global hook that scrolls to the top of the page after the routing.<br/>
This can be achieved by adding the following code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span> (scroll-to-top.js)</span> <a href='http://bilal.eltayara.net/downloads/code/2015-06-21-custom-scrolling-with-meteor/scroll-to-top.js'>download</a></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">IR_AfterHooks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">scrollUp</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;body,html&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">scrollTop</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">Router</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onAfterAction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">IR_AfterHooks</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">scrollUp</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>With these two customizations I was able to have a nice scrolling user experience with my meteor application. <br/>
What about you, do you have interesting customization to share ?</p>

    <link href="http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/05/30/setting-up-wordpress-on-a-vagrant-box/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-30T08:50:16+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://bilal.eltayara.net/blog/2015/05/30/setting-up-wordpress-on-a-vagrant-box</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently wanted to try <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> and explore its features.
For this I chose to install it an all its dependencies in a Vagrant box.<br/>
I followed the official <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">install instructions</a> and automated everything in provisioning shell scripts.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-30-setting-up-wordpress-on-a-vagrant-box/vagrant+wordpress.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Running <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> requires a web server, php support and a <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database.<br/>
I chose use <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> as the box operating system. As a web server I chose to use the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP Server</a>.</p>

<p>My provisioning strategy consisted of two shell scripts.
The first script called provision_once.sh is run only upon the box creation, and has privileged user rights. The second script called provision_always.sh is ran each time the box starts with a non privileged user rights.<br/>
This is specified in the Vagrant configuration file as follows:</p>

<pre><code>config.vm.provision "shell", path: "vagrant/provision_once.sh"
config.vm.provision "shell", path: "vagrant/provision_always.sh", run: "always", privileged: "false"  
</code></pre>

<p>The first part of provision_once.sh script installs required dependencies listed above:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get -qq -y update
apt-get -qq -y install apache2
apt-get -qq -y install php5 
apt-get -qq -y install php5-mysq  
</code></pre>

<p>After installing the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> server, I needed to configure it, and create the required <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> database.<br/>
To setup the root password for the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> server in attended way, one can use debconf-set-selections as shown below. I chose to go with no password as I was setting this up just for test purposes. <br/>
But this would have been too simple, as I expected the unexpected happened. The installation of the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> server didn&rsquo;t go as planned. The <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> server was failing to start. The failure was only happening upon the box creation, doing manually the same steps was installing the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> server correctly.<br/>
After several attempts the only workaround I found was to perform the installation twice in the provisioning script:</p>

<pre><code>for i in {1..2}  
do
    debconf-set-selections &lt;&lt;&lt; 'mysql-server mysql-server/root_password password '  
    debconf-set-selections &lt;&lt;&lt; 'mysql-server mysql-server/root_password_again password '  
    apt-get -qq -y install mysql-server  
done  
</code></pre>

<p>Creating the database is rather straight forward using the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> command-line tool:</p>

<pre><code>mysql -uroot -e "CREATE DATABASE $DBNAME"
mysql -uroot -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON $DBNAME.* to '$DBUSER'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$DBPASSWD'"  
mysql -uroot -e "FLUSH PRIVILEGES"
</code></pre>

<p>Next I needed to automate the download and the configuration of the Wordpress instance.<br/>
The part shown below will download and expand the latest <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> version from the official site.  It&rsquo;ll also configure <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> to use the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database created earlier and generate the required authentication salts.</p>

<pre><code>cd /vagrant
wget -q https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz 
rm -f latest.tar.gz
cd wordpress
cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php   
sed -i.bak -u "s/database_name_here/$DBNAME/g" wp-config.php
sed -i.bak -u "s/username_here/$DBUSER/g" wp-config.php
sed -i.bak -u "s/password_here/$DBPASSWD/g" wp-config.php   
for i in {1..8}
do
    NEW_UUID=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 64 | head -n 1)
    sed -i.bak -u "0,/put your unique phrase here/s//$NEW_UUID/" wp-config.php      
done
</code></pre>

<p>Finally I needed to point the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP Server</a> to the <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> site, this can be achieved as follows:</p>

<pre><code>sed -i.bak -u 's,/var/www/html,/vagrant/wordpress,g' /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

echo '&lt;Directory /vagrant/wordpress&gt;' &gt;&gt; /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
echo '  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks' &gt;&gt; /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
echo '  AllowOverride None' &gt;&gt; /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
echo '  Require all granted' &gt;&gt; /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
echo '&lt;/Directory&gt;' &gt;&gt; /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

service apache2 restart
</code></pre>

<p>The provision always script is simple, it just make sure that the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> is up running upon the box start-up.</p>

<pre><code>if [[ ! "$(sudo service mysql status)" =~ "start/running" ]]
then
    sudo service mysql start
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Finally redirecting the port 80 to the host, makes the <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> instance accessible from the browser, and ready to use.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://bilal.eltayara.net/images/2015-05-30-setting-up-wordpress-on-a-vagrant-box/wordpress-install.png"></p>

<p>The complete configuration is available at my <a href="https://github.com/bil-t/wordpress-vagrant">wordpress-vagrant</a> GitHub repository.</p>
