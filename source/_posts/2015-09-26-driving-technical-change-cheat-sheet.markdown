I enjoyed reading the book [Driving Technical Change: *Why People on Your Team Donâ€™t Act on Good Ideas, and How to Convince Them They Should*](https://pragprog.com/book/trevan/driving-technical-change) by Adobe software evangelist [Terrence Ryan](http://www.terrenceryan.com/).  
It made me recall of a lot of situations I encounter in my daily job. I also discovered new approaches that could come in handy in the future.  
I recommend it to any person having a role to play in a software development division.
